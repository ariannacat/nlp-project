A NY serious consideration of a physical theory must take into account the dis- tinction between the objective reality, which is independent of any theory, and the physical concepts with which the theory operates. A Priori it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something about the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the equations of transformation, for the magnitudes z, y, x, t, are nothing more nor less than the results of measurements obtainable by means of measuring-rods and clocks. A Privy Council is to be formed to which the Jews and Arabs shall each send four representatives, who must be independent of all political parties. A REPLY TO THE SOVIET SCIENTISTS.

A University is a place where the universality of the human spirit manifests itself. A band of light is where two troughs or two crests from waves of the different pinholes meet and reinforce each other,/ The explanation is more com- plicated in the case of the dark and light rings of our previous example in which we used a screen with one hole, but the principle is the same.

A bit of gossip starting in London reaches Edinburgh very quickly, even though not a single individual who takes part in spreading it travels between these two cities. A body at rest gives way before the action of an ex- ternal force, moving and attaining a certain velocity. A body at rest has a definite mass, called the rest mass. A body at rest has mass but no kinetic energy, that is, energy of motion. A body has an inertial mass (re? A body is electrically neutral if the positive and negative electric fluids exactly cancel each other. A body moving with the velocity of light relative to a floating ship moves with a velocity greater than that of light relative to the shore. A body on which no external forces are acting moves uniformly in such a system.
A body, the so-called test body, brought somewhere within the vicinity of the sun will be attracted along the line connecting the centres of the two bodies. A bridge, spatially finite, which connects these sheets characterizes the presence of an electrically neutral elementary particle. A bullet fired from a gun actually moves with a speed greater than that of sound and a man placed on such a bullet would never hear the sound of the shot. A bullet shot from a gun, a stone thrown at an angle, a stream of water emerging from a hose, all describe familiar paths of the same type the parabola. A cat teasing a mouse also creates, by thought, its own primitive reality. A century ago our forefathers, with few exceptions, lived in the ghetto.
A clear recognition of the erroneousness of this notion really only came with the general theory of relativity, which showed that one could take ac- count of a wider range of empirical facts, and that too in a more satisfactory and complete manner, on a foundation quite different from the Newtonian. A clever alteration in this sort of mechanism enabled Joule to measure the heat lost and thus the rate of exchange. A clock at rest at the origin x1 = 0 of K, whose beats are characterized by l = n, will, when observed from K', have beats characterized by l ' = 1?n v2 this follows from the second of equations (29) and shows that the clock goes slower than if it were at rest relatively to K'. A clock at rest rela- tive to the system of inertia defines a local time.
A clock is also a body, or a system, in the same sense, with the additional property that the series of events which it counts is formed of elements all of which can be regarded as equal.
A clock, which is situated at a distance r from the centre of the disc, has a velocity relative to K which is given by V = wr where w represents the angular velocity of rotation of the disc K1 with respect to K. If v0, represents the number of ticks of the clock per unit time (" rate " of the clock) relative to K when the clock is at rest, then the " rate " of the clock (v) when it is moving relative to K with a velocity V, but at rest with respect to the disc, will, in accordance with Section 12, be given by or with sufficient accuracy by This expression may also be stated in the following form: If we represent the difference of potential of the centrifugal force between the position of the clock and the centre of the disc by _, i.e.
A closed vessel contains a certain mass of gas air, for example at a certain temperature. A co-ordinate system K then corresponds to the embankment, and a co-ordinate system K' to the train. A co-ordinate system which is admitted in mechanics is called an inertial system. A comparison of Newton's gravitational laws and Maxwell's field laws will emphasize some of the characteristic features expressed by these equations.
A complete convection of the ''excess " ether p with the full velocity u is optically equivalent to a partial convection of the total ether p, with only a fraction of the velocity k. u. Fresnel showed that if this convection coefficient k is 1 *//x'-^ (/x being the refractive index of the prism), then the velocitv of lio^ht after retraction within the movin"; prism would be altered to just such extent as would make the refractive index of the moving prism quite indepen- dent of its "absolute" velocity u. A complete description of the motion would be very complicated. A complete disappearance of Jewish nationality in Central and Western Europe seemed inevitable. A complete field theory knows only fields and not the concepts of particle and motion.
A complete system of theoretical physics consists of concepts and basic laws to interrelate those concepts and of consequences to be derived by logical deduction. A complete system of theoretical physics is made up of concepts, fundamental laws which are supposed to be valid for those concepts and conclusions to be reached by logical deduction. A completely dark spot means that there are no electrons. A comprehensive definition of reality is, however, unnecessary for our purpose. A conclusion follows at once: the action of an external force changes the velo- city. A configuration is determined by the number of parts allotted to each resonator.
A consequence of the theory was the pressure of light, which plays such an important role in radiation theory and which has just recently been confirmed experimentally. A contemporary has rightly said that the only deeply religious people of our largely materialistic age are the earnest men of research. A contemporary has said, not unjustly, that in this materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only profoundly religious people. A contravariant or co-variant tensor of the 2nd, 3r(l or ith rank is called antuymmetrical when the two com- ponents got by mutually interchanging any two indicjs are equal and opposite. A converging spherical wave is mathematically possible, to be sure; but to approach its realization requires a vast number of emitting entities.
A cor- ollary of this is that in a space whose structure con- sists exclusively of a Riemannian metric, two linear elements PG and P'G', can be compared with regard to their magnitude but not their direction ; in particu- lar, there is no sort of point in saying that the two linear elements are parallel to one another. A cork floating on the wave shows this clearly, for it moves up and down in imitation of the actual motion of the water, instead of being carried along by the wave. A country which demands military service of its inhabitants is compelled to cultivate a nationalistic spirit in them, which provides the psychological foundation of military efficiency.
A courageous scientific imagination was needed to realize fully that not the behaviour of bodies, but 312 THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS the behaviour of something between them, that is, the field, may be essential for ordering and understanding events. A curvature of rays of light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of light varies with position. A danger that cannot be averted had perhaps better be forgotten; or a danger against which every possible precaution has been taken also had probably better be for? A day of ce!ebration genera!ly is in the first piace dedicated to retrospect, especially to the memory of personages who have gained special distinction far the development of the cultural !ife.
A decade or two ago a group of far-sighted men, among whom Herzl of immortal memory stood out above the rest, came to the conclusion that we needed a spiritual centre in crder to preserve our sense of solidarity in difficult times. A decrease in the attraction is noticed and when the pole reaches the middle of the suspended magnet there is no evi- dence of any force at all. A decrease of dens1ty in spa.tial infinity would not have to be assumed, but both the mean potential a.nd mean density would rema.in consta.nt to infinity. A definite value of the coordinate, for a par- ticle in the state given by Eq. A definition of the length and sharpness of the permitted dagger will help only the strongest and most turbulent and leave the weaker at their mercy.
A deformation of the jelly, caused by the rotation of the sphere, moved through the medium. A difficulty seems to appear here. A direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possible at the present time (1920; see Note, p. 48), owing to the fact that the changes in energy E0 to which we can Subject a system are not large enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the inertial mass of the system. A direction as well as a number is essential for the characterization of a velocity, for example. A distinct line means that a comparatively large number of photons belonging to this particular wave-length are emitted; a faint line means that a comparatively small number of photons belonging to this wave-length are emitted.
A distribution of velocities gradually increasing from the confining walls towards the center of the cross section would only establish itself after a time, under the influence of friction at the walls. A disturbance of the (roughly speaking) sta- tionary distribution of velocities over the cross sec- tion would only gradually set in again under the influence of fluid friction. A divided beam of light, after repeated reflections within a ver}^ narrow gap between two massive hemispheres, was allowed to re-unite and thus produce interference bands. A drawing represents our result. A fall in the temperature of matter means a decrease in the average kinetic energy of its particles. A few auxiliary lemmas concerning the fwldamental tensor.

A few years later Hubble showed, by a special investigation of the extra-galactic nebulae (" milky ways "), that the spectral lines emitted showed a red shift which increased regularly with the distance of the nebulae. A field may be re- garded as something always associated with a current. A field which appears to be purely an electric field, judged from one system, has also magnetic field components when judged from another inertial system. A fine and shrewd Russian scholar very skillully defended this point of view to me in comparing the success of compulsion and terror-at least at the outset?
A finely tempered nature longs to escape from personal life into the world of objective perception and thought; this desire may be compared with the townsmans ir- resistible longing to escape from his noisy, cramped surroundings into the silence of high mountains, where the eye ranges freely through the still, pure air and fondly traces out the restful contours apparently built for eternity. A floating cork only bobs up and down, but the wave spreads along a horizontal plane. A four-dimensional continuum described by the "co-ordinates" x1, x2, x3, x4, was called "world" by Minkowski, who also termed a point-event a " world-point." A four-horse carriage goes faster than a carriage drawn by only two horses.
A free material point moves with reference to such a system uniformly in a straight- line. A free material point then !IlOVes, relatively to this system, with uniform motion in a straight line. A freely movable body not subjected to external forces moves, according to the special theory of relativity, in a straight line and uniformly. A freely moving body not acted on by external forces moves, according to the special relativity theory, along a straight line and uniformly. A further important concept, specific heat^is^ gained by the following experiment: let one vessel contain a pound of water and another a pound of mercury, both to be heated in the same way. A further question arises immediately: in what direction does the force act?
A gas can be liquefied by means of a decrease of tem- perature. A geometrical-physical theory as such is incapable of being directly pictured, being merely a system of concepts. A geometry may be developed upon another continuously curved surface, if we observe that an infinitesimally small portion of the surface may be regarded as plane, to within relatively infinitesimal quantities. A glance at (46) thus shows that in this equation, from the second point of view of approximation, we have to aconsider only terms for which . A glance at (46) will also show, that in this equation according to the second view of approximation, we are only to take into account those terms for which /x=v=4.
A glance at equations (23) (24) shows that the Lorentz transformation so defined is identical with the translational and rotational transformations of the Euclidean geometry, if we disregard the number of dimensions and the relations of reality. A glance at the dotted vectors of the last two drawings shows this point clearly. A glance at the drawings shows that here the wave-length is half as great as the one with two nodes. A glance at the equations got in the last two paragraphs shows that, through such a choice, the law of formation of the tensors suffers a significant simplifica- tion. A glance at the equations obtained in the last two sections shows that by sucb a choice the Jaws of forma?

A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life depend on the labours of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving. A hundred years after Newton discovered the law of gravitation, Coulomb found a similar dependence of electrical force on distance. A is a constant characteristic of the metal plate. A is a four-vector whose components are any given functions of i , we have, (with reference to the chosen co-ordinate system) only to put i/.W=A3 <3S(3)=,i53 in order to arrive at the result that S is equal to A .

A just solution of this problem and one worthy of both nations is an end no less important and no less worthy of our efforts than the promotion of the work of construction itself. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in their most elementary forms it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds?
A large body of facts shows undeniably that light has certain fundamental properties that are better explained by Newton's emission theory of light than by the oscillation theory. A law cannot be definite for the one reason that the conceptions with which we formulate it develop and may prove insufficient in the future. A law of motion is given far it, this law of motion being the translation of the law of inertia into the Ianguage of the generai theory of relativity. A leader of his people, unsupported by any outward author? A length, therefore, means the result of a measurement carried out along a straight line by means of a unit measuring rod. A light wave passing near the wheel would have a different speed when the wheel is at rest than when it is in motion.
A light-signal is sent along the positive xaxis, and this light-stimulus advances in accordance with the equation x = ct, i.e. A light-signal, which is proceeding along the positive axis of x, is transmitted according to the equation x = ct or x - ct = 0 . A line of thought developed in one branch of science can very often be applied to the description of events apparently quite different in character. A linear transformation which is accomplished by the matrix A = ^11' ^125 ^135 *14 **15 *'3 23^ ^-^o ^31' ^3 25 '^SS' ^34 ^4 1 ' ^^4 M' ^431^ 4 4 will be denoted as the transformation A By the transformation A, the expression ^1+ . A little consideration will suffice to show us that the most varying emotions preside aver the birth of religious thought and experience.
A little consideration will suffice to show us that the most varying emotions preside over the birth of religious thought and experience. A little later the great English physicist. A little reflection will show that the law of the equality of the inert and the gravitational mass is equivalent to the assertion that the acceleration imparted to a body by a gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. A magnetic field dis- appeared and a spark was created. A magnetic needle supported on a vertical axis obeys the command of the magnetic force of the earth. A man has nothing, either because he really has nothing, or because the amount of money put aside in his safe is exactly equal to the sum of his debts.
A man outside sees, through the glass walls of the moving room (or train if you prefer), every- thing which is going on inside. A man strolls with a velocity of three miles per hour along the deck of a large ship. A man to wbom it bas been given to bless the world witb a great creative idea bas no need for the praise of posterity. A man's ethical behaviour should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. A man's etl1ical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and socia! A man's value to the community depends primarily on how far bis feelings, thougbts, and actions are directed toward promot?
A man's value to the community depends primarily on how far his feelings, thoughts, and actions are directed towards promoting the good of his fellows. A mathematician friend of mine said to me the other day half in jest: The mathe- matician can do a lot of things, but never what you happen to want him to do just at the moment. A me- chanical construction means, as we know, that the substance is built up of particles with forces acting along lines connecting them and depending only on the distance. A metal bar is supported on a glass base, and each end of the bar is connected by means of a wire to an electroscope. A method for calculating the motion of molecules in tne radiation field We now turn to a discussion of the motion of our molecules under the influence of radiation.
A method of generalization is not uniquely determined, for there are usually numer- ous ways of carrying it out. A mixture with molecule numbers n1, n2, with the molecules of the first kind being distinguishable (in particular with respect to the molecule masses m1, m2) only by an arbitrarily small amount from that of the second, therefore yields, at a given temperature, a pressure and a distribution of states which differs from that of a uniform gas with molecule number n1 + n2 with practically the same molecular mass, occupying the same volume. A modification of it seems impossible without de? A moment's consideration shows that the most varied emotions stand at the cradle of religious thought and experience.
A more careful even though a rapid review of the subject will, however, show how the Theory of Relativity gradually became a historical necessity. A more thorough mathematical study of Maxwell's equations shows that new and really unexpected con- clusions can be drawn and the whole theory submitted to a test on a much higher level, because the theoretical consequences are now of a quantitative character and are revealed by a whole chain of logical arguments. A most fundamental problem, for thousands of years wholly obscured by its complications, is that of motion. A movelment of the suspended substance under the influence of the force K acting on each single suspended particle. A moving body has both mass and kinetic energy. A moving charge acts upon a magnetic needle.
A much longer time is required for heating twelve pounds, say, of water in the same vessel by means of the same flame. A mystery story seems inferior if it explains strange events as accidents. A na- tural formulation of the principle of equivalence had thus been found, the extension of which to any gravi- tational field whatever formed a perfectly natural hypothesis. A national army, one might say, is the last piace where national feeling may be expected to weaken. A new reality was created, a new concept for which there was no place in the mechanical description. A noticeable quantity of heat is generated in the wire carrying the current, even enough to melt the wire if it is a thin one. A number alone is, however, insuffi- cient for describing some physical concepts.
A pacific settlement of conflicts and the international cooperation of intellectuals is not possible until military service and the armies are abolished. A pacifism which does not actually try to prevent the nations from arming is and must remain impotent. A pedestrian who observes the misdeed from the footpath notices that the stone falls to earth in a parabolic curve. A people that were to honor falsehood, defamation, fraud, and murder would be unable, indeed, to subsist far very long. A permanent peace cannot be prepared by threats but only by the honest attempt to create mutuai trust.
A person or a nation can be considered peace loving only if it is ready to cede its military force to the intemational authorities and to renounce every attempt or even the means, of achieving its interests abroad by the use of force. A photographic plate would register this diffraction of electronic waves passing through the thin layer of crystal. A photon passes through the hole. A physical entity which is specified by four quantities, A?, in an arbitrary inertial system of the x1, x2, x3, x4,is called a 4-vector, with the components A?, if the A? A physician taking the thermometer from a sick man's mouth might reason like this: "The thermometer indicates its own temperature by the length of its col- umn of mercury.
A piece of paper placed in front of a candle produces a distinct and sharply outlined shadow on the wall. A plane wave travelling through the ether strikes a plate of glass. A planned division of labor is becoming more and more of a crying necessity, and this division will lead to the ma? A planned division of labour is becoming more and more of a crying necessity, and this division will lead to the material security of the individual. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individua!. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual.
A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. A point source is a very small source of light, say, a small open- ing in a closed lantern. A pound of water placed over a gas flame takes some time to change from room temperature to the boiling point. A pretty confirmation of this was imparted in a letter to one of the authors by L Silbersfein. A priori it is by no means certain that this last measurement will supply us with the same result as the first. A procedure something like the following seems, however, to be possible.
A process of diffusion, which is to be looked upon as a result of the irregular movement of the particles produced by the thermal molecular movement. A profound formal distinction exists between the theoretical concepts which physicists have formed regarding gases and other ponderable bodies and the Maxwellian theory of electromagnetic processes in socalled empty space. A proposition is then correct ("true") when it has been derived in the recognised manner from the axioms. A quasi-stationary distribution of velocities is thus produced. A radiation of definite constitution occupies the interior of a cavity of temperature T, and is independent of the cavity's material composition.
A ray of light is sent out from one of the clocks, Um , at the instant when it indicates the time tm , and travels through a vacuum a distance rmn to the clock Un ; at the instant when this ray meets the clock Un the latter is set to indicate the time tn = tm + rmnc 7 . A ray of light requires a perfectly definite time T to pass from one mirror to the other and back again, if the whole system be at rest with respect to the 34ther. A real reporter would make it much more spicy, but I expect this will be enougb for you and your friend N. He reads the above, and some more like it, in the paper next morning, and his rage against you knows no bounds, however cheerful and benevolent his natural disposition may be.

He reads this, and some more like it, in the paper next morning, and his rage against you knows no bounds, however cheerful and benevolent his natural disposition may be. A real theory exists only when the laws of force are given. A realization of how great is the danger is spreading, how? A recipi University of Zurich. A response to a greeting sent by the Liberal M inisters' Club of N ew York City. A revival of Jewish national life, such as the last generation could never have dreamed of, has begun.
A rigid body which, measured in a state of rest, has the form of a sphere, therefore has in a state of motionNviewed from the stationary system the form of an ellipsoid of revolution with the axes R. Thus, whereas the Y and Z dimensions of the sphere (and therefore of every rigid body of no matter what form) do not appear modified by the motion, the X dimension appears shortened in the ratio 1 :, i.e. A satisfactory explanation to the question put forvvard above can only be thus given :that the physical system- composed of S^ and S^ shows for itself alone no con- ceivable cause to which the different behaviour of S, and Sg can be attributed.
A satisfactory interpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the following fact : The same quality of a body manifests itself according to circumstances as " inertia " or as " weight " (lit. " A satisfactory state of affairs can be brought about only by mutual toleration and respect. A satisfying theory can only be reached if we dispense with the ether hypothesis. A second method of application of mechanics, which avoids the consideration of a subdivision of matter down to "real" materia!points, is the mechanics of so-called continuous "I make no hypotheses" media. A second source of religious development is found in the social feelings. A sends a signal by uncovering his lantern. A serious-minded man enjoys a good laugh now and then.
A short summary of the electromagnetic experiments bearing on this question, has already been given in the introduction. A similar conception, being applied to the y- and -s'-axis gives us, when we take into consideration the fact that light when viewed from the stationary system, is always ppopogated along those axes with the velocity^c^ i;^, we have the questions ^- =0, ^- =0. A similar difficulty presents itself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity in such a case, but I do not wish to go any farther into this question. A simple consideration shows that we are able to construct the Lorentz transformation in this general sense from two kinds of transformations, viz.
A simple formai consideration leads to weaker conditions which are closely connected with the Riemann condition. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. A situation is developing similar to the one symbolically represented in the Bible by the story of the Tower of Babel. A small car is lifted or driven to the highest point of the track. A small ship is not an obstacle for waves on the sea, you know; they simply bend around it without casting a shadow. A small sphere with an electric charge is forced, by some ex- ternal influence, to oscillate rapidly and in a rhythmical way, like a pendulum. A small stone, which can be regarded as a particle, is dropped from a tower.
A space time vector of the first kind^ which s represented by the 1x4 series matrix, (41) .9= I .9j ,9, .93 s^ I is to be replaced by 5A in ease of a Lorentz transformation A. i.e. A space-time line taken in any manner can be cut by this figure only at one particular point ; this easily follows from the convexity of the figure on the one hand, and on the other hand from the fact that all directions of the space- time lines are only directions from B^ towards to the concave side of the figure. A spark represents energy, therefore so also must the magnetic field. A special case in w^hich the field-equations sought-for are evidently satisfied is that of the special relativity theorv in which q 's have certain fXV constant values.
A special case in which the required equations must in any case be satisfied is that of the .special theory of relativi ty, in which the gf'Y bave certain constant values. A special task devolves upon the He brew University in the spiritual direction and education of the laboring sections of our people in the land. A stone attached to the end of a string and swung around in a horizontal plane moves in a circular path. A straight line is simpler than a curve. A striking manifestation of the motion of particles in liquids was given for the first time by the so-called Brownian movement, a remarkable phenomenon which would remain quite mysterious and incomprehensible without the kinetic theory of matter.
A sufFicient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. A suitable symbol for it is an arrow. A swinging pendulum placed in water soon comes to rest if not impelled by some external force. A system of co-ordinates of which the state of motion is such that the law of inertia holds relative to it is called a " Galileian system of co-ordinates." A system of magnitudes a/,/, formed into the matrix a 1 1 .a 1 9 a p 1 ,a P H arranged in p horizontal rows, and q vertical columns is called a /; X (/ series-matrix, and will be denoted by the letter A.
A system of the universe with such behaviou1 of the gravitational potentials at infinity would not therefore run the risk of wasting away which was mooted just now in connexion with the Newtonian theory. A theory is the more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises is, the more different kinds of things it relates, and the more extended is its area of applicability. A theory like this being practicall}' useless stands self-condemned. A third ditto Dear Sir, The point with which you deal in your letter is one of prime importance. A transformation which effects this we shall call a "Lorentz transformation." A tremendous e:ffort is indispensable. A tremendous number of particles constituting the gas are moving in all directions.
A trustworthy calculation is not possible in the case of the stars, because in general neither the mass M nor the radius r are known. A universe so constituted would ha.ve, with respect to its gra.vitational field, no centre. A vanisbing of the density at infinity thus implies a vanishing of the density at the centre. A very careful series of measurements carried out independently b}^ Biicherer, Wolz, Hupka and finally Neumann in 1913, decided conclusively in favour of the Lorentz formula. A very important example of motion is that of the earth around the sun. A voltaic battery does not last for ever; the chemical changes associated with the flow of elec- tricity make the battery useless after a time.
A way of escape was now sought in the reverse direction, by reducing the principles of mechanics to those of electricity, and this especially as confidence in the strict validity of the equations of Newtons mechanics was shaken by the experiments with ?-rays and rapid kathode rays. A wonder of such nature I experienced as a child of four or five years, when my father showed me a com- pass.

A work of rescue is being carried out there, with intelligence and a wise moderation, which is based on a grave need, though it may not be a need that is immediately obvious to everyone.
A workable basis had now been found for the general theory of relativity. A world govemment must be created which is able to solve conflicts between nations by judicial decision. A" = grgfJAu.13, Av = go.gv{J A4fS (the " complements " of covariant and contravariant tensors respectively), and Bv = gvga f3Aa f3.

About fifteen years ago nobody had yet doubted that a correct account of the electrical, optical and thermal properties of bodies was possible on the basis of Galileo-Newtonian mechanics applied to the move- ment of molecules and of Clerk Maxwells theory of the electro-magnetic field. About the reasons which explain the extension of the relativity-postulate. About this Document This edition of EinsteinOs Does the Inertia of a Body Depend upon its Energy-Content is based on the English translation of his original 1905 Germanlanguage paper (published as Ist die Tragheit eines Korpers von seinem Energiegehalt abhangig?, in Annalen der Physik.
About two hundred and fifty years later this very principle was used by Fizeau, who was the first to deter- mine the velocity of light by terrestrial experiments. Above all, he must endure the consequences of military secrecy which is one of the worst scourges of our time and one of the greatest obstacles to cultura!betterment. Above all, the idea of acceleration becomes much more strikins: and clear. Above and beyond this valuation of our time we have this further duty, the care for what is eternai and highest amongst our possessions, that which gives to lif e its import and which we wish to hand on to our children purer and richer than we received it from our forebears.
Abraham now deduced a formula for the variation of mass with velocity, on the hypothesis that an electron always remain- ed a rigid sphere. Absolute motion has here a very definite meaning. Absolute motion is made possible only by the idea of an inertial system, for which the laws of nature are valid. Absolute time and the inertial co-ordinate system were abandoned by the relativity theory. Absolute time and the inertial system disappear. Accoi'diiig to the law of differentiation of determinants, we have (28) dg=:g^'' gdg^^=^g^^ gdg^" . Accord- ing to the mechanical theory, refraction is due to forces acting on the particles of light and originating from the particles of glass. Accordinc to the definition, both clocks are synchronous^ if t - 1 = t' - t .
According also to the general theory of relativity, which differs of course from the theory of Newton, a small variation from the Newton-Kepler motion of a planet in its orbit should take place, and in such away, that the angle described by the radius sun-planet between one perhelion and the next should exceed that corresponding to one complete revolution by an amount given by (N.B. According to (11), (9), (13), the mean number ns of molecules per cell is then given by (11a) . According to (18b) and (21), this factor is a certain function of . According to (26) we have the expressions aA ( ) 6BV \ (XV B " cr y.
According to (B), the radiation associated with the solid angle dx' would give rise to B%Q'(V', q>') dx'jAn elementary absorption processes of the type Zn^-Zm per second, if the molecule were to be restored to the state Zn immediately after each such elementary process. According to 71), we have (88) X,+Y, + Z,-f T.=o, and according to 83), T<>o. According to Einstein neither could it be detected with the help of optical or electromagnetic experiments. According to Faraday's experiment, there must be a wire testing the existence of the electric field, just as there must be a magnetic pole, or needle, testing the existence of a magnetic field in Oersted's experiment.
According to Fresnel, the presence of matte: implies a definite condensation of ether within th( t HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 111 region occupied by matter. According to Gauss, this combined analytical and geometrical mode of handling the problem can be arrived at in the following way. According to Heaviside and Hertz, the real seat of both electric and magnetic polarisation is the moving medium itself. According to Hertz and Heaviside the total polarisa- tion is situated in the medium itself and is completely carried awav bv it. According to Hertz, an oscillating Planck resonator radiates energy in the well-known way, regardless of whether or not it is excited by an external field. According to Huygens, light is a wave, a transference of energy and not of substance.
According to LenardOs measurements, however, the largest effective wavelength for air is approximately 1.9 ? According to Lorentz the elementary particles of matter alone are capable of carrying out movements; their electromagnetic activity is entirely confined to the carrying of electric charges. According to Lorentz the elementary particles of matter are capable only of executing movements ; their electro- magnetic activity is entirely due to the fact that they carry electric charges. According to Lorentz's theory, a uniform translational motion of the apparatus of optical experiments does not affect light's progress, if we ignore second- and higher-order terms of the quotient (speed of apparatus)/(speed of light).
According to Lorentz's theory, if a light beam propagates through space, it does so with a speed c in the resting frame K of the ether, independently of the state of motion of the emitting object. According to Newton's law of motion, we have (Force) = (inertial mass) x (acceleration), where the "inertial mass" is a characteristic constant of the accelerated body. According to Newton's theory, a planet moves round the sun in an ellipse, which would permanently maintain its position with respect to the fixed stars, if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves and the action of the other planets under consideration. According to Newtons system, physical reality is characterized by the concepts of time, space, material point, and force (reciprocal action of material points).
According to a result obtained in Section 12, it follows that the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of the clock at the centre of the circular disc, i.e. According to a well-known theorem of Integral Calculus the difference is equivalent to //// ^^^' ^^ ^''' ^^y ^~ ^^ the integrration beins: extended over the whole ranofe of the sichel, and (comp. According to classical mechanics a rigid rod preserves its length in motion or at rest. According to classical mechanics the vertical acceleration of a body in the vertical gravitational field is independent of the hori- zontal component of velocity. According to classical mechanics, the physical laws for a rotating body are different from those for a non-rotating body.
According to classical mechanics, the stone will still reach the earth after four seconds for an observer moving uniformly, relative to the chosen c.s. According to classical physics, observers in two c.s. According to classical physics, two events simultaneous in one c.s. According to general relativity, Mercury's elliptical orbit should rotate slowly around the sun. According to him, a material particle does not move in unaccelerated motion relatively to space, but relatively to the centre of all the other masses in the universe; in this way the series of causes of mechanical phenomena was closed, in contrast to the mechanics of Newton and Galileo. According to his law of gravitation the force of attraction between two bodies depends in a simple way on their distance from each other.
According to mechanics I can imagine bodies with velocities even greater than that of light. According to my belief, the greatest achievement of New? According to our assumption, the ether is carried by the motion and takes a part in it. According to our hypotheses, a momentum K={hvjc) cos cp is transferred to the molecule for each absorption and emission process. According to our law it is clear that there is less pressure at A, owing to the high velocity, than at a greater distance from the aper- ture; at A there is suction, in contrast to the more distant, stationary air. According to our law, the differential-quotient x= -S-^ OS taken along any curve is likewise an invariant.
According to our present knowledge, we have no power to designate the individual atoms condemned to disintegration. According to our prevailing theory, an oscillating ion generates a spherical wave that propagates outwards. According to our rule, the differential quotient = d,Y X ds taken on a curve, is similarly an invariant. According to recent and most excellent measurements by Zeeman, the influence of the velocity of flow v on the propagation of light is represented by formula (B) to within one per cent. According to relativity, the wavelength of light emitted by sodium on the sun should be slightly longer than on Earth.
According to that theory, light rays of slightly different direction, frequency and polarization interfere with one another; variations in the radiation presure correspond to uncorrelated occurrences of interference in the whole. According to the Maxwellian theory, energy is to be considered a continuous spatial function in the case of all purely electromagnetic phenomena including light, while the energy of a ponderable object should, according to the present conceptions of physicists, be represented as a sum carried over the atoms and electrons. According to the Principle of Relativity, the length found out by the operation ), which we may call " the * Vide Note 4>. According to the abuve representation, A B is a scalar, when A and B are tensors.
According to the conception set forth above, deviations from StokesOs Rule are conceivable in the following cases: 1. when the number of simultaneously interacting energy quanta perunit volume is so large that an energy quantum of emitted light can receive its energy from several incident energy quanta; 2. when the incident (or emitted) light is not of such a composition thatit corresponds to blackbody radiation within the range of validity of WienOs Law, that is to say, for example, when the incident light is produced by a body of such high temperature that for the wavelengths under consideration WienOs Law is no longer valid.
According to the conception we have outlined, the possibility is not excluded that a Onon-Wien radiationO of very low density can exhibit an energy behavior different from that of a blackbody radiation within the range of validity of WienOs Law. According to the definition of a fore-cone, rje is to be reckoned as the measure of PQ. According to the equivalence principle, the mass sum M' + M" of the disinte? According to the first three equations it is evident that e is also to be regarded as a vector. According to the formulae of space geometry, D^ denotes a parallelepiped laid in the (;/-^'-0 space, formed out of the vectors (P, P, PJ, (u* U* 11^) (v, V^ V* ).
According to the general relativity theory, gravitation thus plays an exceptional role as dis- tinguished from the others, specially the electromagnetie forces, in as much as the 10 functions g representing gravitation, define immediately the metrical properties of the four-dimensional region. According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense.
According to the general theory of relativity, on the other hand, by application of arbitrary substitutions of the Gauss variables x1, x2, x3, x4, the equations must pass over into equations of the same form; for every transformation (not only the Lorentz transformation) corresponds to the transition of one Gauss co-ordinate system into another. According to the general theory of relativity, the general law of the gravitational field must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in this way. According to the general theory of relativity, the geometrical properties of space are not independent, but they are determined by matter. According to the law of inertia, the velocities before and after the action of the force are both perfectly uniform.
According to the law of motion there must be some force responsible for this change, a force in this case between the stone and the hand holding the string. According to the law of multiplication of determinants, we have ^ 9 av = \ 9^J \ 9 av On the other hand we have ^/xa*^ av h =1 So that it follows (17) that 15 9ixv 9 fXV = 1. According to the method givien above, we prove the tensor character of (A 4- A ), from which on account of symmetry follows the tensor-character of A .
According to the present view regarding the origin of light, the radiation in the space we are considering (radiation which is found for the case of dynamic equilibrium in accordance with the Maxwellian theory) must be identical with the blackbody radiation N at least if oscillators of all the relevant frequencies are considered to be present. According to the principle of special relativity, we must also assume the truth of this principle for every other inertial system. According to the principle-namely, that masses remain unchanged under any physical or chem? According to the relativity theory the time of the collision of the stone with the earth will not be the same for all observers.
According to the rules of connection, used in classical physics, of the spatial co- ordinates and of the time of events in the transition from one inertia! According to the second axiom, the magnitude of the velocity vector | /^ | is <1 at any space-time point. According to the special relati- vity theory, the velocity of light is given by the equation d^^^ d,f rfi; -f-rf.c =o ; 1 2 3 4 thus also according to the generalised relativity theory it is given by the equation (73) ih^^q d.c d.v =zo.
According to the special relativity theory, the theorems of geometry are to be looked upon as the laws about any possible relative positions of solid bodies at rest, and more generally the theorems of kinematics, as theorems which describe the relation between measurable bodies and GBNEEATJSED THEORY OF RELATIVITY 91 . According to the special theory of relativity the four-dimensional continuum formed by the union of space and time retains the absolute character which, according to the earlier theory, belonged to both space and time separately (Minkowski). According to the special theory of relativity, spatial co-ordinates and time still have an absolute character in so far as they are directly measurable by stationary clocks and bodies.
According to the special theory of relativity, the equations which express the general laws of nature pass over into equations of the same form when, by making use of the Lorentz transformation, we replace the space-time variables x, y, z, t, of a (Galileian) reference-body K by the space-time variables x1, y1, z1, t1, of a new referencebody K1. According to the theory developed here, Nernsts theorem is satisfied for ideal gases. According to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a distance or of action at a distance with an infinite velocity of transmission. According to the theory of relativity, there is no essential distinction between mass and energy.
According to the wave theory, on the other hand, a sufficiently small obstacle will cast no shadow. According to this conception, the sole function of education was to open the way to thinking and knowing, and the school, as the out? According to this conception, the sole function of education was to open the way to thinking and knowing, and the school, as the outstanding organ for the people's education, must serve that end exclusively. According to this interpretation the well-known conf!icts between religion and science in the past must all be ascribed to a misapprehen? According to this interpretation the well-known confilcts be?
According to this theory a dissolved mole- cule is differentiated from a suspended body soZeZy by its dirhensions, and it is not apparent why a number of suspended particles should not produce the same osmotic pressure as the same number of molecules. According to this theory a gas is a congregation Of ar> moving in all directions T colliding with^ each other and changing in direction of motiorpwith each collision. According to this theory the metrical properties of the space-time continuum in the neighborhood of separate space- time points are different and conjointly conditioned by matter existing outside the region in question.
According to this theory the metrical qualities of the continuum of space-time differ in the environment of different points of space-time, and are partly conditioned by the matter existing outside of the territory under consideration. According to this theory there is no such thing as a " specially favoured " (unique) co-ordinate system to occasion the introduction of the 34theridea, and hence there can be no 34ther-drift, nor any experiment with which to demonstrate it. According to this we can give the time-axis any possible direction in the upper half of the woild />o. According to this, a ray of light going past the sun under? According to this, the spatial functions which appear in the equations make no claim to be a mathe- matical model of the atomic structure.
According to what has been said, it is evident that the formulation of the general theory of relativity requires a generalization of the theory of invariants and the theory of tensors; the question is raised as to the form of the equations which are co-variant with respect to arbitrary point transformations. According- to (61) its components can be written down in the three-dimensional notation. Accordingly c'^ -times the component of the impulse-vector in the direction of the t-axis is to be defined as the hinetic-energ)/ of the point- mass. Accordingly it follows out of {A}, that (68) 9i + 91. Accordingly we introduce a small constant 0- and let ds'= dx 2dx22 dxa'+(n2x 2+o)dx ~ ' (1a).
Accordingly we say that the plane is an infinite continuum of two dimensions, and space an infinite continuum of three dimensions. Accordingly, a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the signi:ficance and loftiness of those super-persona} objects and goals which neither re? Accordingly, a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance and lof tiness of those superpersonal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational founda? Accordingly, the revolution begun by the introduction of the field was by no means finished.
Accordingly, we need here only to know how F depends on the magnitude of the volume V*, in which all the solute molecules, or suspended bodies (hereinafter termed briefly " particles are contained. Accordingly, we write h23, h31, h12, in place of h1, h2, h3 respectively. AccordiniT to these ideas, the word '' Relativitv-Pastu- late'' which has been coined for the demands of invariance in the group G, seetus to be rather inexpressive for a true understanding of the group Gc, and tor further progress. Accordinsjlv which is the condition that the vectors with the com- ponents ((', y, Zy t) and {x ^ y^ z^ t^) are normal to each other. Active Pacifism I consider myself lucky in witnessing the great peace demonstration organized by the Flemish people.
Actual results of a kind to support the belief in the existence of a complete chain of physical causation hardly existed before Newton. Actually a glance at the development of physics shows that it has undergone far-reaching changes in the course of time. Actually the concepts of time and space appeared at that time to present no difficulties. Actually the in tegra.tion of tbis equation over a tbree? Actually, for the cal- culation of the free energy the energy and entropy of the boundary-surface (surface-tension forces) should also be considered ; these can be excluded if the size and condition of the surfaces of contact do not alter with the changes in position of the partition and of the suspended particles under consideration.
Actually, our diagram should be imagined as a model in space and not as a drawing on a plane. Actually, our own rearmament, through the reaction of other nations to it, will bring about that very situation on which its advocates seek to base their proposals. Addition Theorem for Velocities. Addition-Theorem of Velocities. Additional terms which took account of the existence of the electro- magnetic field had to be included in the fundamental equations for the field. Address at the Grave of H. A. Lorentz It is as the representative of the German-speaking academic world, and in particular the Prussian Academy of Sciences, but above all as a pupil and affectionate admirer that I stand at the grave of the greatest and noblest man of our times.
Address to the Students' Disarmament Meeting Preceding generations have presented us, in a highly developed science and mechanical knowledge, with a most valuable gift which carries with it possibilities of making our life free and beautiful such as no previous generation has enjoyed. Addresses on Reconstruction in Palestine I Ten years ago, when I first had the pleasure of addressing you on behalf of the Zionist cause, almost all our hopes were still fixed on the future. Adjacent points correspond to adjacent values of the coordinates. Administrations come and go; but it is human relations that finally turn the scale in the lives of nations. Advances in technology would provide the possibility of this kind of freedom if the problem of a reasonable division of labor were solved.
Ae c This relationship may be tested experimentally, since the velocity of the electron can be directly measured, e.g. Af te the failure of this attempt, two possibili ties next present themselves. Af ter this digression I come to my proper theme, in the hope that no more weight will be attached to my modest remarks than they deserve. After Maxwell they conceived physical reality as represented by continuous fields, not mechanically explicable, which are subject to partial differential equations. After World War I, Lorentz put a great deal of effort into the reorganization of international cooperation, particularl y among scientists. After all, the only thing we notice is the rise in temperature. After becoming used to the idea that light is a wave, we found, to our .
After further consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at me N and rightly so N and you declare: "I maintain my previous definition nevertheless, because in reality it assumes absolutely nothing about light. After having gained a vivid mental image of the geometrical behaviour of our L' spheres, let us assume that in our space there are no rigid bodies at all in the sense of Euclidean geometry, but only bodies having the behaviour of our L' spheres. After having in full confidence begun with it, I quickly recog? After having in full confidence begun with it, I quickly recognized what a slippery field I had ventured upon, having, due to lack of experience, until now cautiously limited myself to the field of physics.
After many years of effort, however, an appropriate logical unification has been achieved so I believe ^through a new mathematical method, which I have invented together with my distinguished collaborator. After mature consideration the reader will doubtless admit that in reality such encounters constitute the only actual evidence of a time-space nature with which we meet in physical statements. After much effort I succeeded in "proving" this theorem on the basis of the similarity of triangles; in doing so it seemed to me "evident" that the relations of the sides of the right-angled triangles would have to be completely determined by one of the acute angles. After passing through a prism it shows all the colours which exist in the visible world.
After some reflection, I felt how insufficient any such attempt is bound to be. After some time perhaps the following answer would occur to you: "The significance of the statement is clear in itself and needs no further explanation; of course it would require some consideration if I were to be commissioned to determine by observations whether in the actual case the two events took place simultaneously or not." After such bad experiences, this is the moment to forget the ether completely and to try never to mention its name.
After taking account of all the disturbing influences exerted on Mercury by the remaining planets, it was found (Leverrier: 1859; and Newcomb: 1895) that an unexplained perihelial movement of the orbit of Mercury remained over, the amount of which does not differ sensibly from the above mentioned +43 seconds of arc per century. After ten years of reflection such a principle resulted from a paradox upon which I had already hit at the age of six- teen: if I pursue a beam of light with the velocity c (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam of light as a spatially oscilla- tory electromagnetic field at rest. After the First World War, we were confronted with a paradoxical situation regarding the solution of intemational confilcts.
After the Lorentz-transfornation is accomplished the voeocity of matter in the new system of reference for the same space-time point (u' y -J t') is the vector tt' with the ,. After the coordinate is determined, the particle will no longer be in the state given by Eq. After the lamentable breakdown of the old active intercourse between men of learning, I welcome this opportunity of expressing my feelings^ of joy and gratitude towards the astronomers and physicists of England. After the three great powers have drafted a constitution and adopted it, the smaller nations should be invited to join the world govern? After these preparatory works let us engage ourselves with the equations (C,) (D,) (E) by means which the constants c /x, cr will be introduced.
After these preparatory works, which have been first developed on account of the small amount of mathematics involved in the limitting case = 1, /a = 1, o- = o, let us turn to the electro-magnatic phenomena in matter. After thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the following suggestion with which to test simultaneity. After this digression I come to my proper theme, in the hope that no more weight will be attached to my modest remarks than they deserve. After this phenomenon had caused a good deal of trouble to the experts, the Berlin professor of physics, Mag- nus, discovered the right explanation about half way through last century. After this preliminary canter let us consider the liquid motion in a Flettner cylinder.
After this preliminary discussion we come back to the question of the distribution of velocities over the cross section of the stream, which is the controlling factor in erosion. After this success I have no doubt that the material basis for the other faculties will soon be forthcoming. After three hun- dred years we had to return to the initial problem of motion, to revise the procedure of investigation, to find clues which had been overlooked, thereby reach- ing a different picture of the surrounding universe. After tremendous search, the conjecture that the orbit was an ellipse with the sun at one of its foci was found to fit the facts.
After years of preparation the magistrate determines to compromise and raises the question, how long and how sharp the dagger is allowed to be which anyone may carry in his belt when he goes out. Afterwards I found, that those equations in general correspond to covariant ones, if the scalar of the energy tensor of "matter" vanishes. Again "two trees" is different from "two stones". Again Galileo's clue hints at a way of introducing the velocity. Again a light signal is emitted from the centre of the room and again we ask the two men what they expect to observe, assuming only our two principles and forgetting what was previously said concerning the medium through which the light travels. Again a point of light, if the plates are sufficiently thin.
Again a simple example: the same motion of a particle is observed from two c.s. Again a vector diagram shows the answer. Again only the simplest example ! Again the arbitrary smallness of the steps connecting the distant points, each of them represented by three numbers, is characteristic of a three-dimensional continuum. Again the electric field accompanying the changing magnetic field appears as something real. Again the leading statesmen are bur? Again we are in contradiction with experiment. Again we return to our moving room with two observers, one inside and one outside. Again we return to the simple idealized experiment of the cart on a perfectly smooth road. Again we see that the possibilities are restricted by reality.
Again we shall avoid rigorous definitions, using instead analogies with concepts already familiar. Again, a difference is revealed when two c.s. Again, a material point moving along a straight line is observed from two c.s. Again, as Rumford has intimated, we must seek a new clue. Again, in an intense gravitational field, a beam of light will be affected by the local curvature of space, so that to an observer who is referring all phenomena to a Newtonian system, the beam of light will appear to deviate from its path along an Euclidean straight line. Again, it has been a step in the direction of constructive speculation which has increased the distance between the foundation of the theory and what cn be experienced by means of our five senses.
Again, the classical physicist splits the four-dimensional continua into the three-dimensional spaces and the one-dimensional time-continuum. Against such criticism I can defend myself from the personal point of view by assuring you that it is not at my own instance but at the kind invitation of others that I have mounted this rostrum, which serves to commemorate a man who fought hard all his life for the unity of knowledge. Against that intolerance we shall never be safe, whether we call ourselves a "people" (or "nation") or not. Ahead of the notion of objective time there is, however, the concept of space; and, ahead of the latter we :6.nd the con?
Aided by the following illustration, we can readily see that, in accordance with the Lorentz transformation, the law of the transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied both for the reference-body K and for the reference-body K1. Air is only partially an insulator, as everyone who has seen the described experiments kqows. Airy, in 1871 filled up a telescope with waterbut failed to detect any chansje in the aberration. Airy- Boscovitch ivaler-telescoije experimeni.Boscovitcl had still earlier in 1766, raised the very importan question of the dependence of aberration on the refractive index of the medium filling the telescope. Albreeht Einstein Ali means prove but a blunt instrument, if they have not behind them a living spirit.
Albreeht Einstein [A short biographical note by Dr. Meghnad Saha.] Ali means prove but a blunt instrument, if they have not behind them a living spirit. Ali this is of course important and worthy of the best efforts of the finest people. Ali this is put into your hands as your inheritance in arder that you may receive it, honor it, add to it, and one day faithfully band it on to your cbildren. Ali well-meaning people should try to contribute as much as possible to improving such mutual understanding. All are mixed forms, though the moral element predominates in the higher levels of social life. All assumptions concerning ether led nowhere!
All attempts to represent the particle and wave features displayed in the phenomena of light and matter, by direct course to a space-time model, have so far ended in failure. All axes of reference may now be regarded as equally valid. All bodies behave in the way expected by the law of inertia. All clocks, from the simple hour-glass to the most refined instruments, are based on this idea. All consecutive positions of the pole are parallel to each other. All happenings were to be interpreted purely mechan- ically ^that is to say, simply as motions of material points according to Newtons law of motion. All his previous results go to pieces. All human beings, whatever their position in society, are suffering from this process of deterioration. All laws are exactly the same in both.
All light sources, whether moving or at rest in the calm ether-sea, propagate light with the same velocity. All linear measurement in physics is practical geometry in this sense, so too is geodetic and astronomical linear measurement, if we call to our help the law of experience that light is propagated in a straight line, and indeed in a straight line in the sense of practical geometry. All means prove but a blunt instrument if thev have no behind them a living spirit. All movements must be referred to definite sets of co-ordinate axes. All of these endeavors are based on the belief that existence should have a com- pletely harmonious structure.
All of these sources are now in the public domain; this document, derived from them, remains in the public domain and may be reproduced in any manner or medium without permission, restriction, attribution, or compensation. All other cases are analogous. All other lines are just lines offeree belonging to this current and lying on a certain plane. All other notions are - from the physical point of view possessed of meaning only in so far as they are connected, by propositions, of some sort of order among sense im pressions, this order being produced by the creation of general concepts, rela tions between these concepts, and by definite relations of some kind between with the primary notions.
All other notions are-from the physical point of view-possessed of meaning, only in so far as they are connected, by theorems, with the primary notions. All other propositions of geometry are logical inferences from the axioms (which are to be taken in the nominalistic sense only). All our attempts to make ether real failed. All our experiments must be performed on the earth on which we are compelled to live. All our icelUsnhstantiated space-time propositions amount to the determination of space-time coincidences. All our physical statements thus far have lacked something. All our previous remarks on contravariant tensors apply equally to covariant tensors. All our results so far have come from a careful study of these laws, expressed in the field language.
All our space-time verifications invariably amount to a determination of space-time coincidences. All phenomena exhibiting the rectilinear propagation of light support the corpus- cular theory, for just this kind of motion was prescribed for the corpuscles. All physical events were to be THE MECHANICS OF NEWTON 33 traced back to masses subject to Newtons laws of motion. All points of the cord form a one-dimensional continuum, and the deviation is a function defined in this one-dimensional con- tinuum, to be calculated from the equations of the oscillating cord. All possible positions of the two material points form a six-dimensional continuum and not a three-dimensional one as in the case of one point.
All practical geometry is based upon a principle which is accessible to experience, and which we will now try to realise. All problems concentrated around this question immediately bring us to the starting-point of the relativity theory. All problems of optics of moving bodies can be solved after the method used here. All re-marks which we have already made concerning tbe contravariant tensors, hold also for co-variant tensors. All space is the scene of these laws and not, as for mechanical laws, only points in which matter or charges are present. All spatial relations are reduced to those of contact (the inter- section of straight lines and planes, points lying on straight lines, etc.). All such action would cease if those powerf ul elemental forces were to cease stirring within us.
All such phenomena, even the more complicated cases in which light, shadow, and half-shadows appear, can be explained by the assumption that light, in vacua or in air, travels along straight lines. All that has been accomplished is the translation of previously re- cognized facts into an unfamiliar and complicated language. All that has just been said can now be translated into the photon language. All that is necessary is the statement of a set of rules, since without such rules the acquisition of knowledge in the desired sense would be impossible. All that is necessary is to fix a set of rules, since without such rules sitions are partially definitions of the concepts (and of the statements derived the acquisition of knowledge in the de sired sense would be impossible.
All that is necessary is to put on the right hand side of the above equation for Tik, the energy tensor of the electromagnetic feld in empty space and to associate with the so modifed system of equations the Maxwell feld equation for empty space, written in generai covariant form. All that is necessary to avoid contradictions is to choose the remainder of (P) so that (G) and the whole of (P) are together in accord with experience. All that we have said concerning motion can be summed up in a single sentence. All the clocks have the same mechanism, and the lower ones are synchronized, that is, they show the same time simultaneously. All the clocks in the lower c.s. All the clocks show the same time.
All the components are real except those which contain the index 4 once, those being purely imaginary. All the essential ideas in science were born in a dramatic conflict between reality and our attempts at under- standing. All the free end-points of these lengths lie on a spherical surface. All the optical phenomena we have considered speak for the wave theory. All the phenomena of electro-magnetism then known could be explained on the basis of two assumptions : that the ether is firmly fixed in space ^that is to say, unable to move at all, and that elec- tricity is firmly lodged in the mobile elementary particles. All the vectors in the diagram representing this mo- tion have the same length if the speed is uniform.
All theories concerning the motion of "ether" required an alteration of (1) and (2). All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individuai toward freedom. All these electric particles together seemed to create 111 the surrounding space a condition which in turn produced a certain order in the filings. All these equations can be written in purely real figures, and we can then formulate the last result as follows. All these examples are of a purely mechanical charac- ter and we can now formulate the important questions : could we repeat what has just been said of a sound wave, in the case of a light wave? All these primary impulses, not easily described in words, are the springs of man's actions.
All these theories are still highly speculative in character, but they have certainly extended the scope of theoretical phj^sics to the central problem of the ultimate nature of the universe itself. All these things add considerably to the troubles of Europe, but do not materially affect America. All these things make the situation in Europe considerably worse without really affecting America. All this applies as much (and in the same manner) to the thinking in daily life as to the more consciously and systematically constructed thought in the sciences. All this can be judged by the help of the synchronized clocks at rest in our c.s.
All this is merely a repetition of known facts, but the study of Maxwell's equations gives a much deeper insight into the problem of the oscillating electric charge. All this is put into your hands as your inheritance in order that you may receive it, honour it, add to it, and one day faithfully hand it on to your children. All this you call nationalism, and there is something in the accusation. All those motions we observe in nature that of a stone thrown into the air, a ship sailing the sea, a cart pushed along the street are in reality very intricate. All three of them should commit to this world government all of their military strength. All three of them, tluoughout their lives, consid?
All tl1is applies as much (and in the same manner) to the thinking in daily !ife as to the more consciously aud systematically constructed thinking in tl1e sciences. All too frequently conflicts among nations are still being decided by brutal power, by war. All transformations of the coordinates have to be ad? Almost all theories of thermal radiation are based on the study of the interaction between radiation and molecules. Almost imperceptibly the theoretical physicists adapted themselves to a situation which, from the standpoint of their mechanical programme, was very depressing.
Almost imperceptibly theoretical physicists adapted themselves to this state of affairs, which was a most depressing one from the point of view of their mechanistic program, especially un- der the influence of the electro-dynamic researches of Heinrich Hertz. Alone in that way can the individuai obtain the satisfaction to which he is justly en? Along the curve a very small body is moving from left to right. Along this road we arrive at an extension of the postulate of relativity. Along with this most important class of theories there exists a second, which I will call principle- theories. Along with this religion it has to hold up its instrument, brute force, to the admiration of the youth in its schools.
Also Newton's gravitation law of force is distinguished from other conceivable laws of force exclusively by its success. Also that every observer can detect whether his c.s. Also the definition of simultaneity can be given relative to the train in exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment. Also the fundamental equations for electro-magnetic processes in moving bodies are in accordance with the world-postulate. Also the question about the seat of electromagnetic energy is seen to be without any meaning. Also this blow to world trade cannot malte itself very deeply felt in America and therefare cannot be the principal cause of the CTISIS. Also to Mach's question: "How does it come about that inertial systems are physically distinguished above all other coordinate systems?"
Also to the same order of approximation, Lorentz^s form for J corresponds to the conditions imposed by the relativity principle that the components of J, Jirare equal to the components of o-(E+) multiplied by /fZ72 ov .^/f^;:^ respectively. Also we see immediately that the principle of the constancy of light-velocity must be modified, for we recognise easily that the path of a ray of light with reference to K' must be, in general, curved, when light travels with a definite and constant velocity in a straight line with reference to K. 3.
Also, the law permits us to calculate in advance, from precisely determined atom weights, just how much energy will be released with any atom disintegration his fortune to bis sons M' and M", on condition that they give to the communitv a small amount, less than one thousandth ; of the whole estate ( energy or mass ) . Also, the objects with which geometry deals seemed to be of no different type than the objects of sensory perception, "which can be seen and touched."
Although I shall not speak here of those difficulties, it was my concern with them, more than anything else, which led me to the position outlined in this essay.E In the evolution of philosophic thought through the centuries the following question has played a major role: What knowledge is pure thought able to supply independently of sense perception? Although I would prefer not to change the notations used by Lorentz^ it appears important to me to use a different selection of symbols, for thereby certain homo- geneity will appear from the very beginning.
Although a detailed examination of the question shows that the curvature of light rays required by the general theory of relativity is only exceedingly small for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its estimated magnitude for light rays passing the sun at grazing incidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. Although all this sounds learned, it is, really, very simple and hardly worth such detailed discussion, except that we shall find it useful later. Although it is true that it is the goal of science to discover rules which permit the association and foretelling This thought is eonvindngly presented in Herbert Samuel's book, Belief and Actian.
Although it is true that it is the goal of science to discover rules which permit the association and foretelling of facts, this is not its only aim. Although it makes use of the principle of special relativity, it does not presume the formai machinery of the theory but uses only three previously known laws: ( 1) The law of the conservation of momentum. Although it may appear less obvious to cursory examination, it is no less incisive than the :6.rst. Although it may be necessary for our descriptions of nature to employ systems of coordinates that we bave selected arbitrarily, the choice should not be limited in any way so far as their state of motion is concemed.
Although it sounds paradoxical, we could say: Modern physics is simpler than the old physics and seems, therefore, more difficult and intricate. Although less than ten years have passed since Bohr's first dis- covery, the system conceived in its main features and largely worked out by him already dominates both physics and chemistry so completely that all earlier systems seem to the expert to date from a long van- ished age. Although our statement that the earth is a suitable frame of reference is not wholly correct, we shall accept it for the present. Although prevailing cond itions are not the same and some of the suggested reme?
Although purely a matter of convention, it is more convenient to say that four cars travelling away from the same traffic round- about on different roads do not have the same velocity even though the speeds, as registered on the speedometers, are all forty miles per hour. Although the algebraic operations of tensor formation have proved to be as simple as in the special case of invariance with respect to linear orthogonal transformations, nevertheless in the general case, the invariant differential operations are, unfortunately, considerably more complicated.
Although the attempts a so far made are restricted to linear equations, which, as we know from the results of the generai theory of relativity, are insufficient, the complications met up to now by the very ingenious attempts are already terrifying. Although the average kinetic energy is still the same, the collisions of the particles with the piston will now occur more frequently and thus the total force will be greater. Although the difference will be very slight if the velocity of the room is small compared with that of light, the light signal will nevertheless not meet these two opposite walls, which are perpendicular to the direction of the motion, quite simultaneously.
Although the estimated difference between these two times is exceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment involving interference in which this difference should have been clearly detectable. Although the individuals in question are men of the highest reputation, liked and respected everywhere, nevertheless the impression remains. Although the introduction of actions at a distance, which propagate with the speed of light, remains thinkable, according to this theory, it appears unnatural; for in such a theory there could be no such thing as a reason- able statement of the principle of conservation of energy.
Although the radiation is equally constituted in all directions, the molecule will nevertheless be subjected to a force originating from the radiation, which opposes the motion. Although the theory arose from the field problem, it has to embrace all physical laws. Although these con- cepts are now familiar to everyone, we shall examine them closely, emphasizing the differences between tfiem. Although these may sound very fantastic, they will, nevertheless, help us to understand as much about relativity as is possible by our simple methods. Although these tenets would reduce the description of all events to simple forces, they do leave open the question of just how the forces should depend on dis- tance.
Although this problem has already been thoroughly discussed, it is by no means exhausted. Although those di:fferences were by no means funda? Although we can consistently carry out the mechanical view in the domain of electric and magnetic phenomena introduced here, there is no reason to be particularly proud or pleased about it. Although your letter, in the main, is clothed in an attack upon the non-socialistic foreign countries, particularly the United States, I believe that behind the aggressive front there lies a defensive menta!attitude which is nothing else but the trend towards an almost unlimited isolationism. America and the Disarmasnent Conference The Americans of to-day are filled with the cares arising out of economic conditions in their own country.
America is partly to blame for the difficulties of Europe. American youth should understand, first of ali, that even though actual invasion of American territory is unlikely, the United States is liable to be involved in international entangle? Americans may be convinced of their determination not to launch an aggressive or preventive war. Among all the changes which we can perceive in a rigid body those which can be cancelled by a voluntary motion of our body are marked by their simplicity; Poincare calls these, changes in position.
Among all the conceivable spaces Ri and Rg moving in any manner relative to one another, there is a priori, no one set which can be regarded as affording c reater advantages, against which the objection which was already raised from the standpoint of the theory of knowledge cannot be again revived. Among scientists in search of truth wars do not count. Among the hardest hit are the institutions and individuals whose material existence depends directly on the State. Among these, next to the straight line and the circle, the most important were the ellipse and the hyper- bola. An Address delivered on May 5th, 1920, in the University of Leyden. An actual experiment confirms this prediction.
An adherent to the theory of abstrac tion or induction might call our layers "degrees of abstraction" ; but I do not consider it justifiable to veil the logical independence of the concept from the sense experiences. An adherent to the theory of abstraction or induction might call our layers "degrees of abstraction"; but, I do not consider it justifable to veil the logica!independence of the concept from the sense experiences. An admirable account will be found in Perrin's book ^The Atoms.' An almost boundless chaos of philosophical opinions corresponds to these questions and to a few others intimately connected with them.
An analogous considerationNapplied to the axes of Y and ZNit being borne in mind that light is always propagated along these axes, when viewed from the stationary system, with the velocity gives us. An analogous result follows from the motion of clocks. An analogy with a sound wave is possible and quite similar conclusions can be drawn. An analysis of the fundamental concepts of space and time has shown us that the principle of the con- stant velocity of light in empty space, which emerges from the optics of bodies in motion, by no means forces us to accept the theory of a stationary luminif- erous ether. An answer to this question can only then be regarded As satis- factory from the episteomological standpoint when the thin 2: adduced as the cause is an observable fact of ex- perience.
An arbitrary hypothesis was no longer needed to eliminate longitudinal light waves. An assumption should not be regarded as unreasonable simply because it differs from that of classical physics. An autocratic system of coercion, in my opinion, soon degenerates. An effort to arouse and strengthen this sense of responsibility of the individual is an important service to mankind. An electric current possesses energy, for it heats a wire or turns the wheels of a motor. An electron shot at a very small hole will bend like a light wave. An electron to which kinetic energy has been imparted in the interior of the body will have lost some of this energy by the time it reaches the surface. An elliptical universe can thus be considered to some extent as a curved universe possessing central symmetry.
An event, wherever it may have taken place, would be fixed in space with respect to K by the three perpendiculars x, y, z on the co-ordinate planes, and with regard to time by a time value t. Relative to K1, the same event would be fixed in respect of space and time by corresponding values x1, y1, z1, t1, which of course are not identical with x, y, z, t. It has already been set forth in detail how these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical measurements. An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career. An example shows the differences as well as the similarities. An example will make this :lear.
An exceedingly brilliant attempt in this direction has been made by the mathe- matician H. Weyl; but I do not think that it will stand in the face of reality. An exceedingly ingenious attempt in this direction has been made by the mathematician H. Weyl; but I do not believe that his theory will hold its ground in relation to reality. An expanded form of an Address to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin on January 27th, 1921. An expanded form of an Address to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. An extremely simple experiment has already been discussed, in which a screen with a hole was placed in front of a point source of light and a shadow appeared on the wall. An important advance in the life of a people is the transformation of the religion of fear into the moral religion.
An important conclusion can be drawn from the existence and significance of the 4-vector K. Let us imagine a body upon which the electromagnetic field acts for a time. An important property of our sense experiences, and, more generally, of all of our experience, is its time-like order. An individual system of values of {x, y, Zy t) i. e.^ of {x^ x^ rg Xj^) shall be called a space-time point. An individual who should survive his physical death is also beyond my comprehension, nor do I wish it otherwise; such notions are for the fears or absurd egoism of feeble souls. An individua} state with sufficient military and economie power can easily resort to violence and voluntarily destroy the entire structure of supranational security built on nothing but words and docu?
An insufficient consideration of these circumstances is the cause of difficulties with which the electrodynamics of moving bodies have to fight at present. An intemational court of justice had been estab? An interval has a physical meaning which is independent of the choice of co-ordinates; and so has the spherical surface which we obtain as the locus of the end points of all equal intervals that we lay off from an arbitrary point of our space of reference. An lnquiry Inta Afeaning and Truth 119-120, chapter on "Proper Names." An objecti<Mi to this sj'stem of equations, is that according to these, for e=:l, /x=l, the vectors force and induction do not coincide. An observer at rest in the lower c.s.
An observer at rest relatively to K would designate this force as the Biot-Savart force, or the Lorentz electromotive force. An observer at the common origin of co-ordinates, capable of observing the clock at the circum? An observer destined to spend his whole life in the rotating room, and to perform all his experi- ments there, would have laws of mechanics differing from ours. An observer in the train measures the interval by marking off his measuring-rod in a straight line (e.g.
An observer who is sitting eccentrically on the disc K1 is sensible of a force which acts outwards in a radial direction, and which would be interpreted as an effect of inertia (centrifugal force) by an observer who was at rest with respect to the original reference-body K. But the observer on the disc may regard his disc as a reference-body which is " at rest " ; on the basis of the general principle of relativity he is justified in doing this. An obvious answer to this question would seem to be that the minority, the ruling class at present, has the schools and press, usually the Church as well, under its thumb. An organization of intellectual workers can. An outsider can hardly conceive what upbill work iliis was. An outsider can hardly conceive what uphill work this is.
An outstandingly important task for an organizabon of m? An understanding of the conclusions reached in the present paper is not dependent on a knowledge of the former papers or of this paragraph of the present paper. An understanding of this distinction can be gained by considering a very simple experiment. An understanding of this fact prepares us for the generalization introduced into physics by the concept of vectors. An upper limit for the work of ionization can also be obtained from the ionization potentials of rarefied gases.
Analogously we find, starting from (B'), that the corresponding number, per second, of elementary processes for an absorption of the t y p e Zm->Zn is 1 da:' r v mlkT)Bls'(v',(P') v S -p"mexV{-e ' ' " T ' An ' and in such a process a momentum [(smsn)jc\ cos cp' is transferred to the molecule. Analogously we form from the tensors Av and B..., by outer multiplication and double contraction, the inner product Av B". Analogously, I seek in vain for a real something in classical mechanics (or in the special theory of relativity) to which I can attribute the different behaviour of bodies considered with respect to the reference systems K and K1.1) Newton saw this objection and attempted to invalidate it, but without success.
Analogously, in the case of an electron a certain function is determined for any point in space and for any moment. Analogy with classica!mechanics shows that the following is a way to complete the theory. Analytical expression for the Gravitaiionfield. And Heisenberg has convincingly shown, from an empirica!point of view, any decision as to a rigorously deterministic structure of nature is definitely ruled out, because of the atomistic structure of our experimental apparatus. And I am writing seriously and warningly. And also, we can learn from them what is our gravest danger, which we ourselves must seek to avoid: the weakening through inner dissensions, which, when things reach athat point, make cooperation difficult and result in quarrels between the constituent groups.
And because of the traditional dose link between religion and morals, that has brought with it, in the last hundred years or so, a serious weakening of moral thought and sentiment. And even af ter fnding an answer which may satisfy me at this particu? And even after finding an answer which may satisfy me at this particu? And finally, are these field-laws well fitted to represent the properties of the gravi- tational field and the electromagnetic field? And finally, there was the great difficulty with the ether.
And for the same reason, transmutations made by the convening of divers colours are not real; for when the difform rays are again severed, they will exhibit the very same colours which they did before they entered the composition; as you see blue and yellow powders, when finely mixed, appear to the naked eye, green, and yet the colours of the component corpuscles are not thereby really transmuted, but only blended. And for this liberation I have two suggestions: The first has, during war times, been tried and practiced in the past, by those who at great personal sacrifice have refused to do war service. And how much of the metal industry and the chemical industry? And if one asks whence derives the authority of such fondamenta! And if one asks whence derives.
And in fact such a definition is satisfactory when we are concerned with defining a time exclusively for the place where the watch is located; but it is no longer satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of events occurring at different places, orNwhat comes to the same thingNto evaluate the times of events occurring at places remote from the watch. And in order thereto, having darkened my chamber, and made a small hole in my window-shuts, to let in a convenient quantity of the sun's light, I placed my prism at its entrance, that it might thereby be refracted to the opposite wall. And in that way religion often caused enmity and conffict, instead of binding mankind to?
And in the second place, this theory, like the earlier :field theories, bas not up till now supplied an explanation of the atomistic struc? And in this regard much has been accom? And in this respect science resembles the State. And indeed, these specific rules will have to change in keeping with changing circumstances. And it is a comfort that there still exist individuals like yourself, whom one knows to be alive and undismayed. And it is hardly necessary to argue for the view that our existence and our activity acquire meaning only by the setting up of such a goal and of corresponding values. And it is on you, as the strongest and comparatively soundest among us, that the eyes and hopes of all are focused. And just what has been done by the oiling and smoothing?
And let us live after our own fashion there and not ape duelling and drinking customs which are foreign to our nature. And no doubt Descartes had in his own way taken up this quest again. And nobody will maintain that the administration of the school and the attitude of the teachers do not have an influence upon the molding of the psychological faundation far pupils. And nobody will maintain that the administration of the school and the attitude of the teachers does not have an influence upon the molding of the psychological foundation for pupils. And now for the Disarmament Conference. And now just what do the words velocity, change in velocity, and force mean in the general case of motion along a curved line? And now what is to be regarded as the clue to curvilinear motion?
And now, after this dash for liberty, back to the objective! And since these depend largely on the work even of reactionary scientists, they too will help to create the international organization against their wills. And since these depend largely on the work even of reactionary scientists, they, too, will help to create the interna? And so it seems to me that science not only purifies the religious impulse of the dross of its anthropomorphism but also contributes to a religious spiritualization of our understanding of ife. And so it seems to me that science not only purifies the religious impulse of the dross of its anthropomorphism but also contributes to a religious spiritualization of our understanding of life. And such is found to be actually the case.
And the fact that those moral claims were the same for all men, may have had much to do with the development of mankind's religious culture from polytheism to mono? And the high destiny of the individua! And the high destiny of the individuai is to serve rather than to rule, or to impose himself in any other way. And the onlookers mostly keep out of the light, the cowards! And the rest of the world has slowly grown accustomed to these symptoms of moral decay. And the same when he avoided an operation, even in cases which had been sent to him by physicians for surgical treatment in cases of gastric ulcer by neutralizing the pepsin. And these isolated few usually soon lose their zeal for putting things to rights when they have come face to face with human obduracy.
And they believed that those beings, which everywhere dominated their imagi? And this could well bring about the result that even responsible states? And this is by no means surprising. And this is the man whom the students and a good many of the faculty of his university are today doing their best to expel. And this is the man whom the students, and a good many of the staff, of his university are to-day doing their best to expel. And this state of things has even been aggravated by subsequent developments. And those who have an interest in keeping the machinery of war going are a very powerful body; they will stop at nothing to make public opinion subservient to their murderous ends.
And to the timid ones who fear imprisonments by their governments I say: "You need not fear imprisonment, for if you get only two per cent of the population of the world to declare in times of peace, 'We are not going to fight; we need other methods to settle inter national disputes/ this two per cent will be sufficient for there are not jails enough in the world to hold them!" And we wish you further success and happiness in your work for this noble cause. And what a person thinks on his own without being stimulated by the thoughts and experiences of other people is even in the best case rather paltry and monoto? And what is the position and the velocity of the stone at any time after it begins to fall? And what was true for electrical action could not be denied for gravitation.
And when such pictures form series, each member of which calls forth another, this, too, is not yet "thinking." And yet Aristotle, one of the great Greek philosophers, declared slaves inferior beings who were justly subdued and deprived of their liberty. And yet I know that, all in all, man changes but little, even though prevailing notions make him appear in a very different light at different times, and even though current trends like the present bring him unimaginable sorrow. And yet a theory may perfectly well exist, which is in a genuine sense an atomistic one (and not merely on the basis of a particular interpretation), in which there is no localizing of the particles in a mathematical model.
And yet another point: it is shown by calculation that for a given velocity v with reference to the 34ther, this time T1 is different when the body is moving perpendicularly to the planes of the mirrors from that resulting when the motion is parallel to these planes. And yet everybody has certain ideals whch determine the direction of his endeavors and his judg? And yet everybody has certain ideals which determine the direction of his endeavours and his judgments. And yet his contemporaries were by no means satisfied with it, because it seemed to contradict the principle derived from the rest of experience that reciprocal action only takes place through direct contact, not by direct action at a distance, without any means of transmission.
And yet in a way they are more human than we are ourselves, and one almost forgets that they are creations not of Nature, but of Bernard Shaw. And yet in the minds of physicists space remained until the most .recent time simply the passive con- tainer of all events, playing no part in physical hap- penings itself. And yet it is this connection that determines the cognitive value of systems of concepts. And yet nothing truly valuable can be achieved except by the unselfish co-operation of many individuals. And yet notl1ing truly valuable can be achieved except by the disinterested cooperation of many individuals.
And yet so high, in spite of everything, is my opinion of the human race that I believe this bogey would have disappeared long ago, had the sound sense of the nations not been systematically corrupted by commercial and political interests acting through the schools and the Press. And yet such an attitude would be wrong. And yet there is no more common-place statement than that the world in which we live is a fourdimensional space-time continuum. And yet these obscure, humble people had one great advantage over us each of them belonged in every fibre of his being to a community m which he was completely absorbed, in which he felt himself a fully pnvileged member, and which demanded nothing of him that was contrary to his natural habits of thought.
And yet this 5 theory evoked a lively sense of discomfort among Newtons contemporaries, because it seemed to be in conflict with the principle springing from the rest of experience, that there can be reciprocal action only through contact, and not through immediate action at a distance. And yet, that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard. And, in the same way as for the spectrum of an element, only certain wave-lengths are allowed, all others being prohibited. Another attack, even more vigorous, came from an entirely different angle. Another conclusion: a clock on the sun would have a different rhythm from one on Earth due to the stronger gravitational field.
Another consequence of this attitude is that the extremely un? Another consequence of this attitude is that the extremely unequal distribution of property leads to no intolerable hardships. Another distinguished occupant of the same post was Van't Hoff, the eminent physical chemist. Another ditto Dear friend and spiritual brother, To be quite frank, a declaration like the one before me in a country which submits to conscription in peace-time seems to me valueless. Another example of an infinite continuum is the plane. Another important consideration can be related to this method of development. Another question arises immediately : is this identity of the two kinds of mass purely accidental, or does it have a deeper significance?
Another question follows hard upon it : How is it possible for this small clique to bend the will of the majority, who stand to lose and suffer by a state of war, to the service of their ambitions ? Answer: A cross between a mimosa and a porcupine. Anti-Semitism and Academic Youth So long as we lived in the ghetto our Jewish nationality involved for us material difficulties and sometimes physical danger, but no social or psychological problems. Antisymmetrical Tensors.-A contravariant or a covariant tensor of the second, third, or fourth rank is said to be anti? Any easily perceivable modification of mechanics for satisfying the requirements of the Relativity theory would hardly afford any noticeable difference in observable processes ; but would lead to rery * See uQtes on S and 10.
Any force acting on a moving particle changes the velocity, as we already know. Any government is certain to be evil to some extent. Any government is in itself an evil insofar as it carries within it the tendency to deteriorate into tyranny. Any ordinary physical contraction will usually have observable physical results ; for example, the total electrical resistance of a conductor will diminish. Any physical phenomenon may be used as a clock, provided it can be exactly repeated as many times as desired. Any physical theory equivalent to the special theory of relativity, can be included in the general theory of relativity by means of the absolute differential calculus, without that the latter gives any criterion for the admissibility of that theory.
Any social organism can become psychically distempered just as any individual can, especially in times of difficulty. Any such event is represented with respect to the co-ordinate system K by the abscissa x and the time t, and with respect to the system K1 by the abscissa x' and the time t'. Any such line may then be supposed to be given by expres? Any thing which is defined relatively to the system of co-ordinates by four quantities A", and which is transformed by the same law. Any time t of the stationary system K corresponds to a definite position of the axes of the moving system, which are always parallel to the axes of the stationary system.
Any world-point between the fore and aft cones of O, may bv means of the system of reference be res^arded either as synchronous with O, as well as later or earlier than O. Anybody who really wants to abolish war must resolutely declare himself in favour of his own country's resigning a portion of its sovereignty in favour of international institutions: he must be ready to make his own country amenable, in case of a dispute, to the award of an international court. Anyone who has ever disconnected a current must have noticed that a spark appears. Anyone who helps to improve the equipment of these men is helping on the good work at a crucial point.
Anyone who is not prepared to make the fate of his country in case of a dispute depend entirely on the decisions of an international court of arbitration, and to enter into a treaty to this effect without reserve, is not really resolved to avoid war. Anyone who looks at ouT times soberly and dispassionately must admit this. Anyone who looks at our times coolly and dispassionately must admit this. Anyone who only knows scientific research in its practical applications may easily come to a wrong interpretation of the state of mind of the men who, surrounded by skeptical contemporaries, have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered over all countries in all centuries.
Anything we may do for the common purpose is done not merely for our brothers in Palestine, but for the well-being and honour of the whole Jewish people. Anyway, this conception seems to me the most natural: that the manifestation of light's electromagnetic waves is constrained at singularity points, like the manifestation of electrostatic fields in the theory of the electron. Apart from that, it seems to me, moreover, objectionable to treat the indi? Apart from that, it seems to me, moreover, objectionable to treat the individual like a ,dead tool. Apart from these experimental discrepancies, grave theoretical objections were urged against a viscous ether.
Apart from this it was also of profound interest that the statistical theory of classical mechanics was able to deduce the basic laws of thermo- dynamics, something which was in essence' already ac- complished by Boltzmann. Apart from this one, it has hitherto been possible to make only two deductions from the theory which admit of being tested by observation, to wit, the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field of the sun,1) and a displacement of the spectral lines of light reaching us from large stars, as compared with the corresponding lines for light produced in an analogous manner terrestrially (i.e. Apparently only by assuming some interaction between ether particles and matter particles.

Are not the laws of nature so constituted that they re- ceive no real simplification through the choice of any one particular set of co-ordinates ? Are the configurations of rigid bodies, at rest relatively to K', in accordance with the laws of Euclidean geometry?
Are the electrical fluids weightless substances or not? Are there at all any inertial systems for very extended portions of the space-time continuum, or, indeed, for the whole universe? Are these beings able to regard the geometry of their universe as being plane geometry and their rods withal as the realisation of " distance " ? Are these ideas still to be taken seriously? Are they based on mere authority? Are we net all children of one father, as it is said in religious language? Are we not all children of one father, as it is said in religious language? Are you able to answer the simple question as to how the ether is constructed from its elementary particles and how it reveals itself in other phenomena?
Aristotle's great authority throughout Europe was perhaps the chief reason for the long belief in this intuitive idea. Arkadiev) Diffraction of light bending around a small obstacle Diffraction of light passing through a small hole small, and if the source of homogeneous light is strong enough, many light and dark bands will appear on the wall, gradually fading off at the sides into the dark background. Armaments can never be viewed as an economic asset to a state. Arrows of hate have been shot at me too; but they never hit me, because somehow they belonged to another world, with which I have no connection whatsoever. As Eddington saj^s ^' matter does uot cause the curvature of space-time.
As Ernst Mach insistently pointed out, the Newtonian theory is un- satisfactory in the following respect: If one con- siders motion from the purely descriptive, not from the causal, point of view, it only exists as relative motion of things with respect to one another. As I have shown in the previous paper, the general theory of relativity requires that the universe be spatially finite. As I see it, it does not mean a "petitio principii" if one puts the concept of periodica !occurrence ahead of the concept of time, while one is concerned with the clarifcation of the origin and of the empirica!content of the concept of time.
As I see it, this crisis differs in character from past crises in that it is based on an entirely new set of conditions, arising out of the rapid progress in methods of production. As I see it, this crisis differs in character from past crises in that it is based on an entirely new set of conditions, due to rapid progress in methods of production. As a catalogue of these lines was worked out by physicists, the existence of laws gradually became evident, and it was possible to replace some of the columns of seemingly disconnected numbers expressing the length of the various waves by one simple mathematical formula.
As a consequence of his walking, however, he traverses an additional distance w relative to the carriage, and hence also relative to the embankment, in this second, the distance w being numerically equal to the velocity with which he is walking. As a consequence of its motion the clock goes more slowly than when at rest. As a consequence, I am guilty of a certain slovenliness of treatment, which, as we know from the special theory of relativity, is far from being unimportant and pardonable. As a first approximatioD^ we obtain A2 P=2 ^ bir coa^ 4>. As a general rule, the knowledge and the methods which it creates only subserve practical ends indirectly and, in many cases, not till after the lapse of several generations.
As a geodetic-line is defined independently of the system of co-ordinates, it would also be the law of motion for the motion of the material-point* with reference to Kj ; If we put (45) p^ ^ _ we get the motion of Ihe point with reference to K^ given by 2 d ," (1 " (J.v V We now make the very simple assumption that this general covariant system of equations defines also the motion of the point in the gravitational field, when there exists no reference-system K^, with reference to which the special relativity theory holds throughout a finite region. As a glance at (26) will show, this completes the demon? As a matter of fact up to now we have never succeeded in representing corpuscles theoreti?
As a matter of fact, I am convinced that even much more is to be asserted: the concepts which arise in our thought and in our linguistic expressions are all-when viewed logically-the free creations of thought which cannot inductively be gained from sense experiences. As a matter of fact, I am convinced that even much more is to be asserted: the concepts which arise in our thought and in our linguistic expressions are all-when viewed logically-the free creations of thought which cannot inductively be gained from sense-experiences. As a matter of fact, according to classical mechanics, time is absolute, i.e. As a matter of fact, liarmor lias shown (Aether and Alatter) that I 1/V^ is not only sufficient but is also necessary, in order to explain experiments of the Arago prism type.
As a matter of fact, the United Nations is an extremely impor? As a matter of fact, these experiments lead to the conclusion that energy vaues of a state lying abetween the quantum values do not exist. As a matter of fact, we are dealing with freely formed concepts, which, with a certainty sufficient for practical use, are intuitively connected with com plexes of sense experiences in such a ever, satisfy a spirit which is really scien manner that, in any given case of experi tifically minded; because the totality of concepts and relations obtained in this ence, there is no uncertainty as to the manner is utterly lacking in logical unity.
As a matter of fact, we are dealing with freely formed concepts, which, with a certainty sufficient for practical use, are intuitively connected with complexes of sense experiences in such a manner that, in any given case of experience, there is no uncertainty as to the applicability or non-applicability of the statement. As a natural consequence, however, the following question arises : Are two events (e.g. As a natural corollary of this, custom and convention are extremely strong, and there is much more uniformity both in outlook on !ife and in moral and estl1etic ideas among Americans than among Euro?
As a natural corollary of this, custom and convention are very powerful, and there is much more uniformity both in outlook on life and in moral and 34sthetic ideas among Americans than among Europeans. As a number of highly competent scientific workers have already signified their readiness to take up appointments at the university, the establishment of a medical faculty seems to be placed beyond all doubt. As a result I have come to the conclusion that I cannot take a personal part in this extremely important affair, for two reasons: In the first place I am, after all, still a German citizen, and in the second I am a Jew.
As a result of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and space, it became evident that in realily there is not the least incompatibilitiy between the principle of relativity and the law of propagation of light, and that by systematically holding fast to both these laws a logically rigid theory could be arrived at. As a result of the more careful study of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to regard action at a distance as a process impossible without the intervention of some intermediary medium. As a result of this discussion, a most interesting question arises for astronomers and physicists, and that is whether the universe in which we live is infinite, or whether it is finite in the manner of the spherical universe.
As a result of this theory, we should expect that a ray of light which is passing close to a heavenly body would be deviated towards the latter. As a result of this, the acceleration of a body in a pure gravitational field is independent of its mate? As a result of this, the general theory of relativity, which is based on the equality of inertia and weight, provides a theory of the gravitational field. As a result we And that, although we are permitting the determinant g to take on the value 0 (for xi 0), no change of sign of g and in general no change in the "inertial index" of the quadratic form (1) occurs.
As a result, however, of the hopelessness or at any rate the lack of success of those efforts, a gradual revolution in our fundamental notions has taken place since the end of the nineteenth century ; theo- retical physics have outgrown the Newtonian frame which gave stability and intellectual guidance to science for nearly two hundred years. As a result, the energy of the gas molecules would be continuously transformed into the energy of radiation, until all the available energy had turned into energy of radiation. As a second example of a geometrical invariant, consider a volume. As a social being, he seeks to gain the recognition and affection of his fellow human beings, to share in their pleasures, to comfort them in their sorrows, and to improve their conditions of life.
As a solitary being, he attempts to protect his own existence and that of those who are closest to him to satisfy his persona! As a solitary being, he attempts to protect his own existence and that of those who are closest to him, to satisfy his personal desires, and to develop his innate abilities. As a unit matrix (in equations they will be known for the sake of shortness as the matrix 1) will be denoted the following matrix (4 x 4 series) with the elements. As all our physical experience can be ultimately reduced to such coincidences, there is no immediate reason for preferring certain systems of co-ordinates to others, that is to say, we arrive at the requirement of general co-variance.
As already mentioned, this is self-evident, but it must not be confused with the much more comprehensive statement called "the principle of relativity," which we have taken as the basis of our investigations. As already remarked every co-variant tensor of the 2nd rank can be represented as a sum of the tensors of the type A B . As an example, a case of general interest is available in the province of biology, in the Darwinian theory of the development of species by selection in the struggle for existence, and in the theory of development which is based on the hypothesis of the hereditary transmission of acquired characters. As an example, let us consider the emission of radiation from the point of view of classical electrodynamics.
As an illustration let us take the language of Euclidean geometry and algebra. As an illustration let us take the language of Euclidian geometry and Algebra. As being of particular importance, I mention here the fact that the theory of relativity enables us to predict the effects produced on the light reaching us from the fixed stars. As compared whh the standard photograph, the positions of the stars on the eclipse-photograph ought to appear displaced radially outwards (away from the centre of the sun) by an amount corresponding to the angle a. As concerns the gravitational field, it follows from the equation of motion of the materiai point d 2 x. As far as I can judge, the English school system comes nearest to the realization of this ideai.
As far as I can see, people here have no chance of doing this, the result being that the Press, which is mostly controlled by definite interests, has an excessive influence over public opinion. As far as I can see, such an opportunity is !acking in this country, the result being that the Press, which is mostly controlled by vested interests, has an excessive inf!uence on public opinion. As far as I can see, there is no contradiction between these conceptions and the properties of the photoelectric observed by Herr Lenard. As far as I can see, there is one consideration which stands at the threshold of all moral teaching.
As far as I know, no mathematical theory has been advanced that does justice to both its oscillatory structure and its quantum structure, which we derived from the first term of the above formula. As far as we know today, the speed of the secondary cathode rays depends neither on the distance between P1 and P2, nor on the intensity of the primary cathode rays, but rather entirely on the speed of the primary cathode rays. As far as we know, the quantitative consequences of this light-quanta hypothesis are confirmed. As far back as ancient times people devised the lines ex- hibiting the simplest concei\able form of regularity. As field represents energy, all these changes spread- ing out in space, with a definite velocity, produce a wave.
As for me, the normal objective of my thought affords no insight into the dark places of human will and feeling. As for problem (2), its solution obviously needed invariant differential systems of the second order taken from guv. As for the co-ordinates, so too for any other magni? As for the relation E), which introduces the conductivity a we have wS== (w^s^ +0)253 ~1"^3''^3 +^->4-'^4) _ I ^H C+p , This expression j^ives us the rest-density of electricity (see 8 and 4). As for the words of warm praise addressed to me, I shall carefully refrain from disputing them. As ground friction causes a diminution of this force towards the bottom, this force also gives r>se to a circular movement of the type indicated in fi?.
As has already been mentioned more than once, the special theory of relativi ty as a special case of the general theory isacharacterized by the g,,.. having the constant values (4). As has already been observed, any covariant tensor of the second rank can be represented as the sum of tensors qf the By outer multiplication of the vector with arbitrary componente An, A,., A13, A14 by the vector with components 1, O, O, O, we produce a. tensor with componente Au A1, o o o o o o. As he will not make up bis mind to let the velocity of ligbt along the patb in question depend explicitly on tbe time, he will interpret bis observations as showing that the clock at the circumference " really " goes more slowly than tbe clock at the origin.
As in empty space, so too in the interior of material bodies, the ether, and not matter viewed atomistically, was exclusively the seat of electromagnetic fields. As in tbe preceding paper I shall again show that with a uniform distribution of matter, a spherical world is compatible e with the equations. As in that theory, space that is free of matter and radiation is truly empty. As in the special theory of relativity, we have to discriminate between time-like and space-like line elements in the four-dimensional continuum; owing to the change of sign introduced, time-like line elements have a real, space-like line elements an imaginary ds. As is always true in such cases, this division is not to be taken too seriously.
As is well known the latter is exactly described by the metric field' xs dx2 dx3 +A xg dx4 . As is well known, Levi-Civita and Weyl have given a general method for finding axially symmetric static solutions of the gravitational equations. As is well known, Schwarzschild found the spherically symmetric static solution of the gravitation R1 equations 1 ds dl' r (d0 +sill ed/ ) +(I2m/r)dP, (5) (r &2m, 0 from 0 to ir, @ from 0 to 2ir); the vari- ables xl, x2, xs, x4 are here r, 0, p, t. The vanishing of the determinant of the g for 0=0 is unim- portant, since the corresponding (spatial) direction is not preferred. As is well known, he discovered the formula Q, = a.v3 exp ( hvjkT), (1) (2) which is still accepted as correct in the limit of large values of v/T (Wien's radiation formula).
As is well-known, the change is smaller than predicted by the hypothesis of complete participation, although the sense of the change is as expected. As it is, these hard-won achievements in the hands of our generation are like a razor in the hands of a child of three. As it moves its distance from the ground diminishes, but its speed increases. As little as a battle between single ants of an ant hill is essential far survival, just so little is this the case with the individual members of a human commu? As little as a battle between single ants of an ant hill is essential for survival, just so little is this the case with tbe individua! As long as a charge is at rest there is only an electro- static field. As long as armies exist, any serious quarrel will lead to war.
As long as it is moving unifromly, the occupant of the carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for this reason that he can without reluctance interpret the facts of the case as indicating that the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in motion. As long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were capable of representation with the help of classical mechanics, there was no need to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. As long as the cunning citizens do not suppress knifing by legislation, the courts, and the police, things go on in the old way, of course. As long as the possibility of war remains, nations will insist on being as perfectly prepared militarily as they can, in order to emerge triumphant from the next war.
As long as the principle of inertia is regarded as the keystone of physics, this standpoint is certainly the only one which is justified. As long as the stick was at rest, its ends coincided with markings one yard apart on the c.s. As long as their velocities re- main the same, whether great or small, the stick will be undergoing parallel displacement; that is, it does not turn or change its direction. As long as there are sovere1gn nations possessing great power, war is inevitable. As long as there is a conflict of authority between the As? As long as this requirement is not satisfied, I allow myself to be deceived as a physicist (and of course the same applies if I am not a physicist), when I imagine that I am able to attach a meaning to the statement of simultaneity.
As long as we remain within the realm of science proper, we can never meet with a sentence of the type: "Thou shalt not lie." As m is a constant ..jB peculiar to the point of mass, independently of its posi tion, this expression, if we retain the condition ..jg - = 1 at spatial infinity, can vanish only when A diminishes to zero, while B increases to infinity. As marked on the drawing, some lines of force go through the surface bounded by the wire. As mentioned before, the biologica! As mentioned before, the biological nature of man is, for all practical purposes, not subject to change. As one immune from nationalist bias, I personally see a simple way of dealing with the superficial (i.e.
As one may see, the physical notion of space also, as originally used in physics, is tied to the existence of rigid bodies. As our former result shows, velocities exceeding that of light can have no possibility of existence. As reference-body let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. As regards artistic matters, I have been genuinely impressed by the good taste displayed in the modern buildings and in articles of common use; on the other hand, the visual arts and music have little place in the life of the nation as compared with Europe. As regards its space it would be infinite.
As regards religion, on the other band, one is generaliy agreed that it deals with goals and evaluations and, in generai, with the emotional foundation of human thinking and acting, as far as these are not predetermined by the inalterable hereditary disposition of the human species. As regards the fact, I can only reply as follows: What you say about my behaviour is, at bottom, merely another form of the statement you have already published, in which you accuse me of having taken part in atrocity-mongering against the German nation. As regards the final aim, inter While wrestling with the problems, however, one will never give up hope mediary layers are only of temporary that this greatest of all aims can really nature.
As regards the final aim, intermediary layers are only of temporary nature. As regards the first point I must add that I have worked in German institutions and have always been treated with full confidence in Germany. As regards the mechanical nature of Lorentzs ether, one might say of it, with a touch of humor, that immobility was the only mechanical property which Lorentz left it. As regards the munitions industry and the export of war material, the League of Nations has busied itself for years with efforts to get this horrible traffic controlled with what little success, we all know.
As regards this most important need of the age the inhabitants of a small State are better placed than those of a great Power, since the latter are exposed, both in politics and economics, to the temptation to gain their ends by brute force. As results of this confirmation, and other brilliant triumphs, the quantum law is now regarded as a fundamental law of Energetics. As seen from the earth, certain fixed stars appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus capable of observation during a total eclipse of the sun. As soon as a science has emerged from its initial stages, theoretical advances are no longer achieved merely by a process of arrangement. As soon as economic conditions improve.
As soon as one is at home in Hume's critique one is easily led to believe that all those concepts and propositions which cannot be deduced from the sensory raw-material are, on account of their "metaphysical" character, to be removedEfrom thinking. As soon as one is at home in Hume's critique one is easily led to believe tl1at all those concepts and propositions which cannot be deduced from the sensory raw materia! As soon as the particle has hit any particu? As soon as the rotation begins, the physicist has new and unexpected experi- ences. As soon as we make this attempt seriously we come into conflict with that physical interpretation of space and time to which we were led by the special theory of relativity. As such a system let us again choose our embankment.
As the " line element *' ds is a definite magnitude in- dependent of the co-ordinate system, we have also between two points Pj and P.2 of a four dimensional continuum a line for which ItU is an extremum (geodetic line), i.e., one which has got a significance independent of the choice of co-ordinates. As the J inear element d s is defined independently of the system of co-ordinates, the line drawn between two points P and P' of the four-d imensional continuum in such a way that ds is stationary-a geodetic line-has a IUeaning which also is independent of the choice of co-ordinates. As the concept of space was already funda- mental in the latter, we must begin with the concept of space in pre-scientific thought.
As the disc L approaches the luminous point N, the shadow moves off to infinity, and becomes infinitely great. As the divergence of the left side of (4) vanishes identically, this means that among all the field equations those four identities exist which are needed for.their compatibility. As the electromagnetic theory developed, it became ever less of a concern whether the electromagnetic processes could be explained by mechanical processes. As the electron is to be slowly accelerated, and consequently may not give off any energy in the form of radiation, the energy withdrawn from the electrostatic field must be put down as equal to the energy of motion W of the electron.
As the first way out there was religion, which is implanted into every child by way of the traditional education-machine. As the laws are wholly independent of the number of dimensions, we shall leave this number, n, indefinite at first. As the only body competent to take the initiative boldly and resolutely, the UN must act with utmost speed to create the necessary conditions for international security by laying the foundations far a real world govermnent. As the purpose of all physical laws is to allow us to remember such coinci- dences, there is a priori no reason present, to prefer a certain co-ordinate system to another ; i.e., we get the condition of o^eneral covariance.
As the right-hand side of (27) is linear and homogeneous in the A" and their first derivatives, this law of formation leads to a tensor, not only in the case of a tensor of the type A"B., but also in the case of a sum of such tensors, i.e. As the symbols of the indices of summation are immaterial, the first two terms of this expression cancel the second of the one above. As therefore i/r = lcp d x,,, d x,,, ds is also an invariant, and an invariant for all curves starting from a point of the continuum, that is, for any choice of the vector dx. As this notion was developed it became clear that the connection between immediate experience on one side and co-ordinates and time on the other had hitherto not been thought out with sufficient precision.
As to artistic and scientific creation, I hold with Schopenhauer that their strongest motive is the desire to leave behind the rawness and monotony of every day life, so as to take refuge in a world crowded with the images of our own creation. As to science, we may well define it for our purpose as "me? As to tbe transformational character of tbe q(p), whicb describe matter, we make no supposition. As to the interpretation of these equations we make the following remarks: Let a point charge of electricity have the magnitude OoneO when measured in the stationary system K, i.e. As to the mechanical nature of the Lorentzian ether, it may be said of it, in a somewhat playful spirit, that immobility is the only mechanical property of which it has not been deprived by H. A. Lorentz.
As to the part which the new ether is to play in the physics of the future we are not yet clear. As u varies from ~ to + ~r varies from +~ to 2m and then again from 2m to +~. As was remarked previously, a quantum theory free from contradictions can only be obtained if the emission process, just as absorption, is assumed to be directional. As we are concerned here only with ideas, we need not bother with technical difficulties. As we had alreadv occasion to mention, Sommerfeld has, in two papers on four dimensional geometry {vide, Annalen der Physik, Ed. As we know from experience, the intensity of the action on a body dimishes according to a quite definite law, as we proceed farther and farther away from the earth.
As yet only the following bave been suggested: 1) The distortion of the oval orbits of planets round the sun ( confirmed in the case of the planet Mercury ). As=0 AS AY here the integration in //o- is to be extended over the whole surface. Ascending one floor is here no easy task and all attempts so far made to solve the problem must be regarded as unsatisfactory. Aside from the transition to field-theory, i.e., the expression of the elementary laws through differential equations, Maxwell needed only one single hypothetical step N the introduction of the electrical displacement cur- rent in the vacuum and in the dielectrica and its magnetic effect, an innovation which was almost prescribed by the formal properties of the differential equations.
Aside from this result, the theory frees :field pbysics from the disability it suffered from, in common with the New? Assume that an electron or a shower of electrons, provided they all have the same velocity, is moving uniformly. Assume that light propagates with speed V in a certain object, if the object is at rest. Assume the two vessels are closed with identical pistons, on which are equal weights. Assuming that the field equations of gravitation are of the second differential arder, the field law is clearly determined.
Assuming that we know, let us say, the statistical distribution of the stars in the Milky Way, as well as their masses, then by Newton's law we can calculate the gravitational field and the mean velocities which the stars must have, so that the Milky Way should not collapse under the mutual attraction of its stars, but should maintain its actual extent. Assuming that we know, let us say, the statistical distribution of the stars in the Milky Way, as well as their masses, then by Newtons law we can calculate the gravitational field and the mean velocities which the stars must have, so that the Milky Way should not collapse under the mutual attraction of its stars, but should maintain its actual extent.
Assuming this contraction to be a real one, the distance travelled with respect to the ether is %lp and the time taken for this journey is 2l^/c. Assumptions (1) and (2), i.e., the relativity theory, force us to give up this view. Asymptotic from for the Entropy of Monochromatic Radiation at Low Radiation Density From existing observations of the blackbody radiation, it is clear that the law originally postulated by Herr W. Wien, ? At A and at B it is an energy of position, or "potential" energy; at C it is an energy of motion, or "kinetic" energy. At C, on the other hand, the lifting height has disappeared and instead of it the mass has a velocity v. It is as though the lifting height could be converted entirely into velocity, and vice versa.
At P, let us draw the tangent to the world-line, and let us draw from P^ the normal to this tangent. At a given moment two observers simultaneously take snapshots, one of the origin of the stick and the other of the end. At a later instant one obtains then from the Schrodinger equation a 'li' function of the form iv = Cr'i'r where the Cr are ( complex ) constants. At a later stage this direct connection is lost insofar as some words convey relations to perceptions only if used in connection with other words (for instance such words as: "is", "or", "thing"). At a later stage this direct connection is lost insofar as some words convey relations to perceptions only if used in connection with other words (for instance such words as: "is", or,"thing") .
At a sitting of the Academy during the War, at the time when nationalism and politica! At a time T = ^ = i> let a spherical wave be sent out ' from the common origin of the two systems of co-ordinates, and let it spread with a velocity c in the system K. If {,c, y, z)y be a point reached by the wave, we have with the aid of our transformation-equations, let us transform this equation, and we obtain by a sin^ple calculation, Therefore the wave is propagated in the moving system with the same velocit}' e, and as a spherical wave.^ Therefore we show that the two principles are mutually reconcilable. At a time like the present, ed by the Albert Einstein Archives, the Jew ish National & University Library, the He when experience forces us to seek a new brew University of Jerusalem, Israel.
At a time like the present, when experience forces us to seek a newer and more solid founda? At a time wben a towering personality like Mme. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. At all events we know with great exactness that this velocity is the same for all colours, because if this were not the case, the minimum of emission would not be observed simultaneously for different colours during the eclipse of a fixed star by its dark neighbour. At all events, a definite decision will be reached during the next few years. At all intermediate posi- tions, where there is some velocity and some elevation, it has both kinetic and potential energy.
At any ])oint P of such across-section, we can introduce by means of a Lorentz transformation a system of refer- ence (o', y, :' i)i so that according to this a _o 6 _n 9 -0 9 ^0 -^7 -'^' a? At any rate we shall see that by means of this assumption we obtain the correct expression for the integral energy principle. At any rate, our calculations bave convinced me that such conditions of degeneration for the g,,.. in spatial infinity may not be nost ulated. At any rate, this view is logically consistent, and from the standpoint of the general theory of relativity lies nearest at hand ; whether, from the standpomt of present astronomical knowledge, it is tenable, w1ll not here be discussed.
At best, it outlines a programme for an explanation holding out at least some hope of a future under- standing of diffraction by interaction between matter and photons. At every section of its course, where it is bent, a centrifugal force operates in the direction of the outside of the curve (from A to B). At every stage we try to find an explanation consistent with the clues already discovered. At first I found equations, that contain Newton's theory as approximation and that are covariant in respect to arbitrary substitutions of the determinant 1. At first it might seem possible to determine the mean density of matter by observation of that part of the universe which is accessible to our perception.
At first people tried, clinging to the mechanical mode of thought, to look upon it as a mechanical condition (motion or force) of a hypothetical medium by which space was filled up (the ether). At first sight the revolution in scientific thought brought about in the course of a single decade appears to be almost too violent. At first sight the solution seems ohvious. At first sight this assumption is entirely reasonable, for the information obtainable from a wave function seems to correspond exactly to what can be measured without altering the state of the system. At first, however, this applies only far electromagnetic fields in empty space.
At first, the straight lines which radiate from the starting point diverge farther and farther from one another, but later they approach each other, and finally they run together again at a "counter-point" to the starting point. At first, then, instead of asking what religion is I should prefer to ask what characterizes the aspirations of a person who gives me the impression of being religious: A person who is religiously enlightened appears to me to be one who has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfsh desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings, and aspirations to which he clings because of their super-persona !value. At first, this conclusion, reached by following the acoustical analogy, seems strange and incomprehensible.

At its highest point the car has potential energy but no kinetic energy or energy of motion. At its highest point the car has zero velocity and is one hundred feet from the ground. At its lowest point it has the greatest kinetic energy and no potential energy whatever. At least all the difficulties are concentrated on one point.
At present it is being so weak as to tolerate parleying with the worst enemies of civilization. At present the Russians have no evidence to convince them that the American people are not contentedly supporting a policy of military preparedness which they regard as a policy. At present there is only one way of answering the first three questions. At present we must wait for new experi- ments and conclusions, but finally, I hope, we shall be able to clear up the problem of the mechanical structure of the ether. At present, we must still assume both field and matter. At rest, the density of the matter, or the energy per unit volume, is in this case, not ?
At such times, these stars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the sun by an amount indicated above, as compared with their apparent position in the sky when the sun is situated at another part of the heavens. At that thrilling moment he surely never guessed that the riddling nature of light, apparently so completely solved, would continue to bafile succeeding generations. At that time the view obtained that everything was to be hoped for from enlightenment in the field of ascertainable scien? At the age of twelve I experienced a second wonder of a totally different nature: in a little book dealing with Euclidian plane geometry, which came into my hands at the beginning of a school year. At the beginning of the experiment there is no motion at all.
At the beginning they are walking straight ahead, both with the same velocity. At the bot- tom there are some tea leaves, which stay there because they are rather heavier than the liquid they have displaced. At the definite K time, l = 0, the position of the points given by the integers x'1 = n , is with respect to K, given by x1 = n 1?v2 ; this follows from the first of equations (29) and expresses the Lorentz contraction. At the end of a certain time the weights will have reached their lowest position and the clock will have stopped. At the end of the short time interval T, the momentum of the molecule will have the value Mv Rvr + A. At the lowest pos- sible point it is no distance from the ground, and has its greatest velocity.
At the moment it no longer stands for a medium built up l6o THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS of particles. At the present time it is particularly disturbing that the gravitational field and the electrical field should enter into the theory as mutually independent funda- mental concepts. At the present time we know that electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic considerations only for the case, which is never strictly realised, in which the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to each other, and to the co-ordinate system. At the present time, different opinions are being held about the fundamental equations of Eleetro-dynamics for moving" bodies. At the present time, however, such a program looks like an attempt to breathe in empty space.
At the present, we are quite without any deterministic theory directly describing the events them? At the same time I shall remark for which value of c, this invariance can be conclusively held to be true. At the same time a deep yearning for that great consummation, the internal and external liberation of mankind from war, shines out from the ruthless logic of your expositions. At the same time it wields enormous influences on the govem? At the same time minimum wages must be fixed in such a way that the purchasing power of the workers keeps pace with production. At the same time minimum wages must be lixed in such a way that the pur? At the same time the motion of the free materia!
At the same time they imitated the external forms of Gentile life, departed more and more from their religious and social traditions, and adopted Gentile customs, manners, and habits of thought. At the same time, as social beings, we are moved in the relations with our fellow beings by such feelings as sympathy, pride, hate, need for power, pity, and so on. At the same time, the motion of a free point-mass in the new GENEEALTSED TITEOBY OF RELATIVITY lOl co-ordinates, will appear as curvilinear, and not uniform, in which the law of motion, will be independent of the nature of the moving mass-points. At the time ^ , a ray of light goes out fi^m A, is.
At the time his work was done, the mathematical technique of other physical theories was very subtle and compli- cated, comparatively speaking. At the time t = 0 let all three origins coincide, and when t = x = y = z = 0 let the time t0 of the system K0 be zero. At the time t= Oy all the initial co-ordinate points coincide, and for t=j=y=zz= o, the time t' of the system k' =^o. At the turn of the century the theoretical physicists of al1 nations considered H. A. Lorentz as the leading mind among them, and rightly so. At these known moments, therefore, SM always presents the same base, while the earth is always at a different point in its orbit. At these points the mass m is higher by the amount h than it is at C, the lowest point of the path ( see drawing ).
At this juncture the question of the validity of the principle of relativity became ripe for discussion, and it did not appear impossible that the answer to this question might be in the negative. At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. At this moment, a current will appear for a very short time and then vanish. At this point an enigma presents itself which in all ages has agitated inquiring minds. At this point somebody will say, "That is nonsense. At this point somebody will say, That is nonsense. At this point we may interrupt the dialogue, though the subject is by no means exhausted. At this point we still lack a theory for those parts of space in which electrical density does not disappear.
At this stage it is already possible to report somewhat complex series of impressions; we can say that language has come to existence. At this stage it would indeed be difficult to convince him that he is wrong. At this stage of the discussion it would be useless to argue with a supporter of the substance theory, for this is a matter which can be settled only by experiment. At this stage, with the kind assistance of the mathe? At times I feel certain I am right while not knowing the reason. At two distant points we have two perfect clocks, showing exactly the same time. Atoms of a particular element, say, hydrogen, can emit only photons with definite energies. Atoms of radioactive matter, radium for instance, act as batteries which fire projectiles with enormous velocities.
Attempts to explain this phenomenon are very old. Averting that threat has become the most urgent problem of our time. Awareness of this state of affairs overshadows every hour of my present existence, while ten years ago it did nt yet occupy my thoughts.

Be it said parent11etically that, just as on the part of a real philosopher, quotation marks are used here to introduce an illegitimate concept, which t11e reader is asked to permit far the moment, although the concept is suspect in t11e eyes of the philosophical police. Be it said parenthetically that, just as on the part of a real philosopher, quotation-marks are used here to introduce an illegitimate concept, which the reader is asked to permit for the moment, although the concept is suspect in the eyes of the philosophical police. Bear in mind that the wond erful things you leam in your scbools are the work of many generations, produced by enthu?
Bear in mind that the wonderful things you learn in your schools are the work of many generations, produced by enthusiastic effort and infinite labour in every country of the world. Bearing in mind that and putting + m and taking into consideration only the first and third terns on the right-hand side, we get from this equation This is the well-known differential equation for diffusion, and we recomise that D is the coeecient of diffusion. Bearing in mind that during the whole process of motion which we are considering, the first of the equations (A) applies, we therefore obtain W =.
Bearing in mind this last relation, we see that we have as many independent equations at our disposal as are neces- sary for determining the motion of matter as well as the vector 11 as a function of .c, j/, r, f, when proper funda- mental data are given. Because Galileo saw this, and particularly because he drummed it into the scientific world, he is the father of modern physics indeed, of modern science altogether. Because among all substitutions there are, in every case, contained those, which correspond to all relative motions of the co-ordinate system (in three dimensions). Because each one of us must bear his share of the burden of this generation, I ask you to con- sider these suggestions, and to discuss them with your neighbors.
Because each seeks his own wretched momentary advantage and refuses to subordinate it to the welfare and prosperity of the community. Because in the Middle Ages all the directly productive vocations were closed to us, we were driven to adopt purely mercantile vocations. Because of her tenacious belief in "free enterprise" she can? Because of our inability to salve the problem of international organization, it has actually contributed to the dangers which threaten peace and the very existence of mankind. Because of the "absolute" character of time, the transition from the "static" to the "dynamic" picture of motion has an objective meaning in classical physics.
Because of the irregularity of the collisions between the gas molecules and the plate, the latter is moved such that its average kinetic energy is one-third of the kinetic energy of a monatomic gas molecule. Because of the symmetry about the hypersurface g =0, the sign of g (loes not change at this hypersurface. Because of these circumstances the United States is com? Because of this , the four-dimensional con- tinuum falls naturally into a three- i dimensional and a one-dimensional I (time), so that the four-dimensional I point of view does not force itself upon one as necessary. Because of this difference in velocity along the wave front during the time of "immersion" in the glass, the direction of the wave itself will be changed.
Because of this, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the general principle of relatvity. Because we believe that these massless solutions are the physically important ones we will consider here the case m =0. Because we were then excluded from all directly productive occupations, we were forced into the purely commercial ones. Before God we are relatively all equally wise equally foolish. Before I go into these, however, I must ob- serve that the theory of relativity resembles a build- ing consisting of two separate stories, the special theory and the general theory.
Before I go into this I must insist that Newton himself was better aware of the weaknesses inherent in his intellectual edifice than the generations of scientists which followed him. Before I take this up I must briefly mention a number of investigations which relate to the Brownian motion and related objects (fluctuation-phe- nomena) and which in essence rest upon classical molecular mechanics. Before considering these transformations in detail we shall make a few general remarks about space and time. Before doing so, however, we shall have to say a few words in justification of this approach. Before doing so, we must mention one more theoretical and experimental result of a more special character.
Before formulating the underlying assumptions of this new theory, however, we must answer a question in no way connected with these optical considerations. Before long they were, on the contrary, actually trying to explain material points and their inertia on field theory lines with the help of Maxwells theory, an attempt which did not, however, meet with complete success. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn the reader against a misconception suggested by these considerations. Before proceeding we must discuss some physical phenomena in which matter as well as radiation plays an essential role. Before solving this problem, let us try to decide which answer should be preferred. Before the War, Lorentz's activities in the cause of interna?
Before the absorption let M be the mass of B;a Mv is then the expression of the momentum of B ( according to M' - M = E c2 This equation expresses the law of the equivalence of energy and mass. Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the canservation of energy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental laws appeared to be quite independent of each other. Before the development of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics were looked upon as the laws of electricity. Before the development of the theory of relativity it was known that the principles of energy and momentum could be expressed in a differential form for the electromagnetic field.
Before the interruption of the current, there was a magnetic field surrounding the wire. Before the theory of relativity was put forward, it was difficult to become reconciled to this negative result, for reasons now to be discussed. Before the war Lorentz's activities in the cause of international relations were confined to presiding at congresses of physicists. Before we analyse further the conditions which define the Lorentz transformation, we shall introduce the light-time, l = ct , in place of the time, t, in order that the constant c shall not enter explicitly into the formulas to be developed later. Before we apply the tensor theory to the four-dimensional space-time continuum, we shall examine more particularly the skew-symmetrical tensors.
Before we deal with this, we shall introduce the following incidental consideration. Before we draw any conclusions from these two principles we must first review the physical significance of the concepts "time" and "velocity." Before we enter into the discussion, a very important point must be noticed. Before we tackle the problem of whether it is possible to maintain the relativity principle, let us briefly consider what happens to the ether hypothesis, if we maintain the relativity principle. Before we try to account for the attempts of modern physics to explain the contradiction between the quantum and the wave aspects of light, we shall show that exactly the same difficulty appears when dealing with quanta of matter instead of quanta of light.
Before witnessing its decline, let us provisionally ac- cept the point of view held by the physicists of the past century and see what conclusions we can draw from their picture of the external world. Behaviour of measuring rods and clocks in a statical gravitation-field. Behind the tireless efforts of the investigator there lurks a stronger, more mysterious drive : it is exist- ence and reality that one wishes to comprehend. Being a Swiss citizen, he also, it seems, intends to resign the Prussian nationality which he acquired in 1913 simply by becoming a full member of the Academy. Being based upon this knowledge, which precedes all mathematics, the axiom stated above is, like all other axioms, self-evident, that is, it is the expression of a part of this a priori knowledge.
Below are two of the questions fol? Below, we sec stripes when light is allowed to pass through both pin holes simultaneously (Photographed by I'. Berlin, April 7, 1933 The Prussian Academy of Sciences. Berliner's achievement was :70 IDEAS AND OPINIONS only possible because his longing for a clear, comprehensive view of as large as possible an area of scientific investigation has remained so strongly alive.

Berliner's fight for clarity and comprehensiveness of outlook has done a great deal to bring the problems, methods, and results of science home to many people's minds. Besides the electromagnetic field, only the electric current density appears as an independent entity.

Besides these points, there can be in the space any number of other movable points of any kind. Besides this gas (which we can imagine as consisting of only a few molecules), we assume that there is also thermal radiation at the gas temperature. Besides this momentous episteomological argument> there is also a well-known physical fact which speaks in favour of an extension of the relativity theory.

Besides, one always cuts a poor figure if one complains about others who are struggling for their place in the sun too after their own fashion. Between n points of space there are n n( ?1) distances, s? Between the coordinates of the sheet system and those of each bridge system there must exist outside of the hypersurfaces g=0, a regular coordinate transformation with nonvanishing determinant. Between the curves u= 1 and u= 2 we must imagine an infinitely large number to be drawn, all of which correspond to real numbers lying between 1 and 2.
Between the lena:ths and times measured locallv on the one hand, and the differences in co-ordinates dx on the other, we have the relation ds^ = a (I >' d,r . ' Between the quantities x, t, and ?, which refer to the position of the clock, we have, evidently, x = vt and . Between the time sections, l = l1, and l = l2, but not extending to them, a portion of the strip is shaded. Between them all other colours are arranged. Beyond t11at, however, the "system" is (as regards logie) a free play witl1 symbols according to (logically) arbitrarily given rules of the game. Beyond that, however, the "system" is (as regards logic) a free play with symbols according to (logical) arbitrarily given rules of the game.
Beyond this, however, my interest in the knowledge of nature was also unqualifiedly stronger; and it was not clear to me as a student that the approach to a more profound knowledge of the basic principles of physics is tied up with the most intricate mathematical methods. Bloiidlot (Comptes llcndus, lUU]) passed a current of air in a steady magnetic field PI ,,, (H =H.. =0). Bodies which are moving under the sole influence of a gravitational field receive an acceleration, which does not in the least depend either on the material or on the physical state of the body. Bodies with velocities approaching that of light would offer a very strong resistance to external forces. Bohr's theory forms an intermediate step toward a deeper and more general theory, called the wave or quantum mechanics.
Books on physics are full of complicated mathematical formulae. Both are equally valid; they are merely different descriptions of the same physical reality. Both churches and universities-insofar as they live up to their true function-serve the ennoblement of the indi? Both formed a basis for quantitative de- scription. Both in classical mechanics and in the special theory of relativity we therefore differentiate between reference-bodies K relative to which the recognised " laws of nature " can be said to hold, and reference-bodies K relative to which these laws do not hold. Both in life and in detective novels the crime is given. Both obey conservation laws: An isolated sys- tem cannot change either in mass or in total energy.
Both of these assumptions, which are of fundamental importance for geometry and especially for physical measurements, naturally arise from experience; in the theory of general relativity their validity needs to be assumed only for bodies and spaces of reference which are infinitely small compared to astronomical dimensions. Both representations can be used with equal right, though classical physics favoured rather the dynamic picture describing motion as happenings in space and not as existing in time-space. Both the above-mentioned principles are power- fully supported by experience, but appear not to be logically reconcilable. Both the quantities are tensors according to the above general remarks ; in it lies its significance.
Both these hypotheses proved to be consistent, according to the general theory of relativity, but only after a hypothetical term was added to the field equations, a term which was not required by the theory as such nor did it seem natural from a theoretical point of view (" cosmological term of the field equations "). Both these pictures are exactly equivalent, and preferring one to the other is merely a matter of convention and taste. Briefly speaking, it would mean that all actions of a solenoid through which a current flows and of a corresponding bar magnet are the same, since the field alone is responsible for them, and the field in both cases is of the same character. Briefly speaking, the laws of classical mechanics are valid for the observer inside the lift.
Briefly: the Schrodinger equation determines the alteration of the function J of the qr with the time. Bringing a positive pole near acts as a "command of division" to the fluids, attracting the negative fluid of the iron and repelling the positive. Brown answered this question by re- peating the experiment with many different plants, and found that all the granules, if sufficiently small, showed such motion when suspended in water. Brown was working with grains of pollen of certain plants, that is: particles or granules of unusually large size varying from one four-thousandth to about five-thousandth of an inch in length.
Bu t taken from a psychological viewpoint, this combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in pro- 26 IDEAS ANO OPINIONS ductive thought-before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated to others. BuL Blondlot failed to detect any such eft'ect. Buddhism, as we have learned es? Buddhism, as we have learnt from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer especially, contains a much stronger element of it. Building up of neio tensors wit/i the help of the fundamental tensor.

But America is a large country and its people have so far not shown much interest in great international problems, among which the problem of disarmament occupies first place today.
But Berliner has come to the rescue, as far as the German-speaking world is concerned, in the most admirable way: He saw that the existing popular periodicals were sufficient to instruct and stimulate the layman; but he also saw that a first-class, well-edited organ was needed for the guidance of the scientific worker who desired to be put sufficiently au courant of developments in scientific problems, methods, and results to be able to form a judgment of his own. But Berliner has come to the rescue, as far as the German-speaking world is concerned, in the roast admirable way. But E. Mach recognsed it most clearly of all, and because of this objection he claimed that mechanics must be placed on a new basis.
But Eddino'ton has pointed out that even if this test fails, the logical conclusion would seem to be that while Einstein's law of gravitation is true for matter in bulk, it is not true for such small material systems as atomic oscillator. But Einstein found a support for the new-born concept in another direction. But Einstein was not satisfied with the study of the special problem of Relativity for uniform motion, but ALBERT EINSTEIN 39 tried, in a series of papers beginning from 1911, to extend it to the case of non-uniform motion.
But I am convinced that even if the U.S.A. and Russia were both capitalist countries-or communist, or monarchist, for that matter -their rivalries, conflicting interests, and jealousies would result in strains similar to those existing between the two countries today. But I am now no longer able to adjust the quadrilateral so that its diagonals may be equal. But I am of opinion that the communication of my rather comprehensive work on this subject will not pay, for nothing essentially new comes out of it. But I am persuaded that such behavior on the part of the representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. But I bave said nothing yet about tbe choice of subjects far instruction, nor about tbe metbod of teacbing. But I cannot envisage the clock- maker.
But I could not remain deaf to the appeal of the O.R.T. But I do not suggest that the American failure to outlaw the use of the bomb except in retaliation is the only cause of the absence of an agreement with the Soviet Union aver atomie control. But I do think it essential that we should come forward with a positive programme; a merely negative policy is unlikely to produce any practical results. But I have said nothing yet about the choice of subjects for instruction, nor about the method of teaching. But I must confess that such a complete resignation in this fundamen tal question is for me a. difficult thing. But I object to such an assumption.
But I should like to add that I have always honoured and admired that highly developed sense of justice which is one of the noblest features of the French tradition. But I would not want to live in such a world." But Ido not think that the communication of my somewhat extensive re:flexions on this subject would be worth while, because af ter all th do not give us anything that is rnaterially new. But J is also independent of any special choice of the position of the domains of the centres of gravity and of the magnitude of V*, as will be shown immediately. But Lorentz is not to be deterred, once he has recognized a course of action as the right one. But Lorentz was not to be deterred, once he had recognized a course of action as the right one.
But Maxwell's new theoretical idea goes beyond these experimental facts. But Newton's gravitational law opposed all our efforts to fit it into the scheme of special relativity. But The terms arising from the last two terms in round brackets are of different sign, and resul t from each other (since the de? But Wilson's ether is almost whollv nesfative its onlv virtue beinoj that it does not directly contradict observed facts. But a causal conception of motion was still far from being achieved. But a communal purpose, without which we can neither live nor die in this hostile world, can always be called by that ugly name. But a current begins to flow through the rim-wire as soon as the number of lines passing through the surface surrounded by wire changes.
But a current from the point of view of the field theory means the existence of an electric field forcing the flow of the electric fluids through the wire. But a different conception is reached from the standpoint of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat. But a further question concerning motion arises im- mediately. But a glance at (70a) and (69) shows that the expected difference is much too small to be noticeable in the measurement of earth's surface. But a magnetic field appears as soon as the charge begins to move. But a presentation of its principles thus clarified makes it also evident that mathematics as such cannot predicate anything about perceptual objects or real objects.
But a simple and apparently quite reliable consideration seems to suggest that, for the present at any rate, there is little hope of success in such an attempt; Let us imagine ourselves transferred to our old friend the railway carriage, which is travelling at a uniform rate. But a world government is preferable to the far greater evil of wars, particularly with their intensifed destructiveness. But according to Newtonian dynamics, such alteration in physical movements can only be due to the effeet of ceitain forces in the tield.^ Thus any change of axes will introduce new ' geometrical" forces in the field which are quite independent of the nature of the body acted on. But according to Section 21 the general theory of relativity cannot retain this law.
But according to the first axiom^ when u ^=.0^ these equations must be exactly equivalent to (1) the differential equations (^'), (^')j which are obtained from the equations {A), (B) by simply dashing the symbols in (A) and (B). But actual observation failed to detect the slightest disturbance of the ether in the gap, due to the motion of the hemispheres. But again the physical interpretation of the quantities determined in these two cases is quite different. But again, we can also learn from the workers that limita? But all directions in space must be equivalent to each other. But all efforts directed towards this object, and even the celebrated interference-experiment of Michelson have sj'iven nciirative results.
But all experiments have shown that electro-magnetic and optical phenomena, relatively to the earth as the body of reference, are not influenced by the translational velocity of the earth. But all such attempts failed to reveal the slightest trace of any optical disturbance due to the "absolute" velocity of the earthy, thus proving conclusively that all tne different optical effects shared in the general compensation arising out of the Fresnelian convection of the excess ether. But all the same we could characterise it as a medium. But all this is scarcely physics. But all this sounds very suspicious. But all trains moving uptown at different stations or on different avenues with the same speed have the same velocity, which may be represented by a single vector.
But an atomic theory in the true sense of the word (not merely on the basis of an interpretation) without localization of particles in a mathematical model, is perfectly thinkable. But an innocent visitor must not be expected to rack his brains too much, and when al! But are they not quite right, these watchful citizenesses? But are we not in danger of speculating too far from reality? But as a consequence of the deflection of light from the star by the sun, the star will be seen in the direction D2, i.e. But as it happens, nine of tbe equations (la), and three of the equations (6) are independent of one another.
But as long as the principles capable of serving as starting points for the deduction remain undiscovered, the in- dividual fact is of no use to the theorist; indeed he cannot even do anything with isolated empirical gen- eralizations of more or less wide application. But as motion is relative and any frame of reference can be used, there seems to be no reason for favoring one c.s. But as regards the deductions from the theories which are capable of being tested, the agreement between the theories may be so complete that it becomes difficult to find any deductions in which the two theories differ from each other.
But as the construction progresses it becomes more and more patent that the disposition of the discs in the manner indicated, without interruption, is not possible, as it should be possible by Euclidean geometry of the plane surface. But as the construction progresses it becomes more and more patent that the disposition of the discs in the manner indicated, without interruption, is not possible, as it should be possible by Euclidean geometry of the the plane surface. But as the fundamental tensor plays a special part in our tbeory, which has its physical basis in the peculiar effects of gravita tion, it so happens that the relations to be developed are of importance to us only in the case of the fund amental tensor.
But at present they appear to be guided by their fears, and one must admit that the United States has made ample contributions to these fears, not only as to atomic energy but in many other respects. But at present we are far from possessing any supranational organisation compet- ent to render verdicts of incontestable authority and enforce absolute submis- sion to the execution of its verdicts. But before mankind could be ripe for a science which takes in the whole of reality, a second funda- mental truth was needed, which only became common property among philosophers with the advent of Kep- ler and Galileo. But before proceeding farther, it ought to be pointed out that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract one, for reasons which will become evident at a later stage.
But before stating these it is necessary to point out that the theory of relativity is like a house with two separate stories, the spe- cial theory and the genera! But behind every achievement exists the motivation which is at the faundation of it and which in turn is strengthened and nourished by the accomplishment of the undertaking. But behind every achievement exists the motivation which is at the foundation of it and which in turn is strengthened and nourished by the accomplishment of the undertaking. But bere it proved that far the system of the fixed stars no boundary con? But between the clear vision of this goal and its actual realisation it was necessary to surmount a serious difficulty, and as this lies deep at the root of things, I dare not withhold it from the reader.
But beyond a definite XXll PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY distance from an observer^ time itself stands still, so that to the observer nothing can ever " happen " there. But by an inversion of (9) B'" = :! But by building up the theorv it must be shown whether olectro-mao-netism and gravitation together can achieve what the former alone did not succeed in doing. But by introducing the somewhat artificial weightless ether we at once get rid of the much more artificial light corpuscles. But calculation shows that in a quasi-Euclidean universe the average density of matter would necessarily be nil. But can we not simplify our problem? But can we really think of them as two distinct realities? But contact between the intellectual and the masses must not be lost.
But deterrence should be the only purpose of the stockpile of bombs. But does the force depend only on the distance, and if so, how? But does the thermometer contain the same amount of heat as the body of the man? But does this work in the case of a voltaic battery? But during this short interruption an intricate process takes place, a process which could again have been foreseen by the field theory. But each mass is seen to rotate by an observer at rest re- lative to the other mass round the connecting line of .the masses with a constant angular velocity (definite relative motion for both the masses). But eireumstances are stronger than men. But electrons are also the elementary quanta of negative electricity.
But enough has been said by those who do to indicate that the bomb has been made more effective. But enough men capable of thinking, and enough books, would be left to start again, and civilization could be restored. But equation (4a) also allows an important conclusion as to tbe behaviour of G within the domains having a density of electricity other than zero. But even apart from that, I have this justification for my pains, that it may possibly interest you to know how a man thinks about his science after having devoted so much time and energy to the clarification and reform of its principles. But even more than all this, it established a single general principle which served to connect together in a simple coherent and fruitful manner the known facts of Physics.
But even on Stokes' theory this viscous How of ether would fall ofP at a very rapid rate as we recede from the surface of separation. But even the concept of the "real external world" of everyday thinking rests exclusively on sense impressions. But even this feeble hope is dashed by our previous discussion of another experimental arrangement. But even this problem we shall solve as free men and we shall not allow ourselves for its sake to be driven into a slavery, which ultimately would bring with it stagnation of every healthy development. But even this very depression confirms me in the Conviction that the preservation and the consolidation of this community is our duty. But events turned out otherwise.
But every change in velocity is due to the action of an external force; thus the force must also be represented by a vector. But every experiment designed to demonstrate this ether had a negative result, so that one was driven to a very strange hypothesis to understand why such a relative motion was not detectable. But every statement expressed in the corpuscular language can be translated into the wave language, just as in the case of photons. But everyone devoted to the specific European ideals will do his utmost to achieve aims of whose desirability and practicability an in? But everyone who cares for civilization and justice must exert all his strength to convince his fellows of the necessity for laying all countries under an international obligation of this kind.
But evolution has showA that at any given momenf, out of all conceivable con- structions, a single one has always proved itself absolutely superior to all the rest. But fear still more the coming of another war or wars. But few pause to reflect on the brilliant methods by which Kepler deduced the real orbits from the apparent ones i.e., from the movements as they were observed from the earth. But for our purpose it is necessary to associate the fundamental concepts of geometry with natural objects; without such an association geometry is worthless for the physicist. But for this case w = o, we immediately arrive at the equations (82) and (83) by means (45), (51), (60) on the one hand, and 6^ = eE, M = /xm on the other hand.
But for this, these latter would simply be free inventions of the human mind which admit of no a priori justification either through the nature of the human mind or in any other way at all. But from relativity, we know mass and energy are equivalent. But from the point of view of daily life, without going deeper, we exist for our fellow-men in the first place for those on whose smiles and welfare all our happiness depends, and next for all those unknown to us personally with whose destinies we are bound up by the tie of sympathy. But from the point of view of the narrower group there would at first exist no reason for rep- resenting gravitation by so compli- cated a structure as is represented by the symmetric tensor g.^.
But from the point of view of the relativity theory the static picture is the more convenient and the more objective. But from the point of view of the relativity theory, time as well as space is changed by passing from one c.s. But hardly anyone conld be found who would deny these partial successes and ascribe them to human self-deception. But hardly anyone could be found who would deny these partial successes and ascribe them to human self-deception. But he certainly believes that, as his knowledge increases, his picture of reality will become simpler and simpler and will explain a wider and wider range of his sensuous impressions.

But he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic existence. But he himself failed to attach any special significance to it, and looked upon it rather as a mere mathematical artifice like imaginary quantities in analysis or the circle at infinity in projective geometry. But he is compelled by nobody to refer this jerk to a " real " acceleration (retardation) of the carriage. But he made use of several such constructions at the same time and took none of them really seriously, so that the equations alone appeared as the essential thing and the strength of the fields as the ultimate entities, not to be reduced to anything else. But he prudently avoided my questions.
But he remarks that aii upper value of k may be calculated from the observations of the double sar ^-Aurigae. But heat is certainly not a substance in the same sense as mass. But here, at the outset, I come up against a difficulty ; a tribunal is a human institution which, in proportion as the power at its disposal is inadequate to enforce its verdicts, is all the more prone to suffer these to he deflected by extrajudicial pressure. But historic tradition is, so to speak, of yesterday; nowhere have we really overcome what Thorstein Veblen called "th.e predatory phase" of human development.

But how Maxwell's theory would have to be modified in a natural fashion, for this even the special theory of rela- tivity offers no adequate foothold. But how can we find a more rational way out of our dilemma? But how can we lind a more rational way out of our dilemma? But how does the man in the chest regard the Process ? But how is this heat connected with motion? But how shall one try to attain this ideai? But how to ascertain the real shape of the earths orbit ?
But however that may be, and whatever fate may have in store for us, yet we may rest assured that without the tireless e:fforts of those who are concerned with the welfare of humanity as a whole, the lot of mankind would be stili worse than in fact it even now is. But if - g is always finite and positive, it is natural to settle the choice of co-ordinates a posteriori in such a way that this quantity is always equal to unity. But if I direct my efforts towards objects which do not suit them, they immediately turn to abuse and calumny in defence of their interests. But if I now approach you with the request to explain to me the sense of the statement more precisely, you find after some consideration that the answer to this question is not so easy as it appears at first sight.
But if I now notice a luminous something of bluish colour under the first pan but not under the other, I cease to be astonished, even if I have never before seen a gas flame. But if every gram of materia!contains this tremendous energy, why did it go so long unnoticed? But if experience is the beginning and end of all our knowledge about reality, what role is there left for reason in science? But if one goes on to ask who they are, one finds oneself in no inconsiderable difficulties. But if rods of every kind (i.e. But if the electromagnetic :field could exist as a wave inde? But if the loi:ging f r the achievement of the goal is powerfully alive within us, then shall we not lack the strength to find the means for reaching the goal and far translating it into deeds.
But if the longing for the achievement of the goal is powerfully alive within us, then shall we not lack the strength to fnd the means for reaching the goal and for translating it into deeds. But if the magnet be at rest and the conductor be set in motion, no electric field is produced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, but an electromotive force which corresponds to no energy in itself is produced in the conductor; this causes an electric" current of the same magnitude and the same career as the electric force, it being of course assumed that the relative motion in both of these cases is the same. But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion, no electric field arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet.
But if the quantity of electricity be at rest relative to the moving system (at least for the moment considered), then the force acting upon it, and measured in the moving system is equivalent to the vector (X', Y', Z'). But if the universe is spatially finite there is a second deviation from the Newtonian theory, which, in the language of the Newtonian theory, may be expressed thus: The gravitational field is in its nature such as if it were produced, not only by the ponderable masses, but also by a mass-density of negative sign, distributed uniformly throughout space.
But if the universe is spatially finite there is a second deviation from the Newtonian theory, which, in the language of the Newtonian theory, may be expressed thus:The gravitational field is in its nature such as if it were produced, not only by the ponderable masses, but also by a mass-density of negative sign, distributed uniformly throughout space. But if there is agreement on certain goals and values, one can argue rationally about the means by which these objectives may be attained. But if there is one such system, then there is an infinite number of them. But if there lS agreement on certain goals and values, one can argue ration_ally about the means by which these objectives may be attamed.
But if these hypotheses on the interaction between radiation and matter turn out to be justified, they must produce rather more than just the correct statistical distribution of the internal energy of the molecules: for there is also a momentum transfer associated with the emission and absorption of radiation; this produces, purely through the interaction between the radiation and the molecules, a certain velocity distribution for the latter. But if this basis is assumed, the expression for the force of gravity seems to be derivable from experience; and the same derivability was to be anticipated for the other forces.
But if this part is very small indeed, they will no longer be able to demonstrate that they are on a spherical " world " and not on a Euclidean plane, for a small part of a spherical surface differs only slightly from a piece of a plane of the same size. But if we are concerned with the structure only on a large scale, we rnay represent matter to ourselves as being uniforrnly distribu ted over enormous spaces, so that its density of distribution is a variable function which varies J84 COSMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS extremely slowly. But if we assume the universe to be spatially finite, we are prompted to the hypothesis that p is to be independent of locality.
But if we conceiveEuclideangeometryas the science of the possibilities of the relative placing of actual rigid bodiesand accordinglyinterpretit as a physicalscience,and do not abstract from its original empirical content, the logical parallelismof geometryand theoreticalphysics is complete. But if we direct our attention to prominent features of tbe landscape, like high mountains, the scenery seems to change very slowly. But if we do this, with the help of the field, we immediately notice the character of all those actions at the moment when the similarity between the field of a solenoid and that of a bar magnet is seen.
But if we may take the curve a.long which we have differentiated to be a geodetic, we obtain on substitution for d2xv/ds2 from (22), l2cp lcp )d x,,, dxv X = (l x,,.l xv - {.v, r}lx, ds ds a Since we may interchange the arder of the differentiations,and since by (23) and (21) {v, r} is symmetrical in and v, . But if, on the other hand, there is no unique direction in space it is not logical to formulate the laws of nature in such a way as to conceal the equivalence of systems of coordinates that are oriented differently. But in a couple of centuries there comes another, perhaps, who refutes him.
But in addition to K, all bodies of reference K1 should be given preference in this sense, and they should be exactly equivalent to K for the formulation of natural laws, provided that they are in a state of uniform rectilinear and non-rotary motion with respect to K ; all these bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian reference-bodies. But in bis will he bequeaths mass-for instance, if I beat it by 10 degrees. But in blaming the Russians the Americans should not ignore the fact that they themselves have not voluntarily re? But in collaboration with de Haas, Einstein planned and successfully carried out this experiment, and proved the essential correctness of Ampere's views.

But in general one restricts oneself to a discussion of the energy exchange, without taking the momentum exchange into account. But in order to explain the null Arago effect, Stokes was compelled to assume the convection hypothesis of Fresnel with an identical numerical value for kj namely 1 V/^'- '^hus the prestige of the Fresnelian convection-coefficient was enhanced, if anything, by the theoretical investigations of Stokes. But in practical application the two agree so closely that it has been difficult to find some cases in which the actual diHerences could be subjected to observation. But in quantum physics the state of affairs is entirely different. But in reality such methodological differences do exist. But in reality there are atoms and the void.
But in reality this is not the case. But in reality, the time for remaining in state Zn per second is equal to S-ipn exp(-SnlkT) from (5), where the abbreviation S =pn exp( en/kT) + pm exp( sm/kT) (20) has been used. But in sketching the way in which it was accomplished we must be even vaguer than we have been so far. But in the four-dimensional continuum of classi- cal physics the subspaces with con- stant time value have an absolute reality, independent of the choice of the reference system. But in the neighbor- hood of the walls of the cup the liquid is restrained by friction, so that the angular velocity with which it circulates is less there than in other places near the center. But in the realm of electric and optical phenomena we meet grave difficulties in this application.
But in the relativity theory, we have something more. But in the struggle for these solutions new and deeper problems have been created. But in the theory I advanced the acceleration of a falling body was not independent of the horizontal velocity or the internal energy of a system. But in the triangle SEM we also know the angle at S. Therefore, with the base SM arbitrarily laid down on a sheet of paper, we can, in virtue of our knowledge of the angles at E and S, construct the triangle SEM. But in this case there will also be pressure terms, which depend upon the space derivatives of the u?. But in this case, the phenomena of diffraction seem quite incom- prehensible. But in this point Newton is particularly consistent. But in this theory a new idea arose from our reasoning.
But in view of the more recent development of electrodynamics and optics it became more and more evident that classical mechanics affords an insufficient foundation for the physical description of all natural phenomena. But in what follows we shall soon see that this conclusion cannot be maintained. But inertial resistance opposed to relative acceleration of distant masses presupposes action at a distance; and as the modern physicist does not believe that he may accept this action at a distance, he comes back once more, if he follows Mach, to the ether, which has to serve as medium for the effects of inertia. But inertial resistance with respect to the relative acceleration of distant masses presupposes direct action at a distance.
But instead of being allowed to touch the metal the rubber is now only brought near it. But intellectual workers should unite, not only in their own interest but also and no less importantly in the interest of society as a whole. But is it correct to say that the two spheres have the same velocity? But is it possible to describe all physical phenomena by forces of this kind alone? But is it possible to determine such small wave- lengths experimentally? But is this the only kind of wave? But it .is not necessary to imagine the earth being de? But it always remains for the future to decide whether we chose the only possible way out and whether or not a better solution of our difficulties could have been found.
But it can also be described by a static picture thrown on to the background of a four-dimensional time-space continuum. But it can exert a decisive infiuence through its regolative function if its measures are framed in an objective spirit by independent experts. But it can exert a decisive influence through its regulative function if and there again you are right its measures are framed in an objective spirit by independent experts. But it can not be claimed that those parts of the generai relativity theory wbicb can to-day be regarded as :final bave furnisbed pbysics with a complete and satisfactory foundation. But it cannot be repeated for our elementary quanta of matter, that is electrons, or for quanta of energy, that is photons.
But it continues to gain more and more ground because of the everwideninglogical gap between the basic concepts and laws on the one side and the consequencesto be correlatedwith our experiences on the other-a gap which widens progressivelywith the developing unificationof the logical structure, that is with the reductionin the numberof the logically independentconceptual elements requiredfor the basis of the whole system. But it could not be called a foundation, since nobody could tell whether a consistent :field theory could ever explain on the one hand gravitation, on the other band the elementary components of matter. But it does not satisfactorily explain why the rainbow is re- peated from time to time, and why always in connection with rain.
But it has not as yet gone beyond the area of mora!authority as, in my opinion, it must. But it is also this development which turns language into a dan? But it is also this development which turns language into a dangerous source of error and deception. But it is by no means evid ent a priori that we may lay down tbe same limiting conditions when we wisb to take larger portions of tbe physical universe into consideration. But it is clear tbat any covarian vector can be represented in tbe form S,,,. But it is conceivable that our universe differs only slightly from a Euclidean one, and this notion seems all the more probable, since calculations show that the metrics of surrounding space is influenced only to an exceedingly small extent by masses even of the magnitude of our sun.
But it is different from the religion of the naive man. But it is different from the religiosity of the naive man. But it is easy to show that any 16 quantities A'^^, can be represented as the sum of A'^ B of properly chosen four pairs of four-vectors. But it is essential that not every energy level should be permitted, since not every wave-length, not every photon-energy, appears in the spectra of an element. But it is extremely hard to determine exactly what industries should be included. But it is just as well to state a thesis starkly and nakedly, if one wants to clear up one's mind as to its nature.
But it is my chief aim to develop the theory in such a manner that the reader perceives the psychological naturalness of the way proposed, and the fundamental assumptions appear to be most reasonable according to the light of experience. But it is my conviction that in the present stage of development of theoretical physics these ideas must still be employed as independent ideas; for we are still far from possessing such certain knowledge of theoretical principles as to be able to give exact theoretical constructions of solid bodies and clocks. But it is not known whether this principle will remain true in the case of other ])hysical laws. But it is not possible without further assumption to compare, in respect of time, an event at A with an event at B.
But it is significant how the constants in the exponential term are related to the coefficient of diffusion. But it is steadily gaining ground from the fact that the distance in thought between the fundamental concepts and laws on one side and, on the other, the conclusions which have to be brought into relation with our experience grows larger and larger, the simpler the logical struc- ture becomes ^that is to say, the smaller the number of logically independent conceptual elements which are found necessary to support the structure. But it is their strength that will decide whether the human race must relapse into that hopeless condition which a blind multitude appears to-day to regard as the ideal.
But it is this very lowness that confirms me in the conviction that it is our duty to preserve and consolidate our community. But it may equally well happen that clearly formulated principles lead to conclusions which fall entirely, or almost entirely, outside the sphere of reality at present accessible to our experience. But it must not be assumed that intelligent thinking can play no part in the formation of the goal and of ethical judg? But it proved inadeguate in the face of the special theory of relativity. But it remained a bold ambition, the problematical ideal of a school of philosophers. But it rnust not be assumed that intelligent thinking can play no part in the formation of the goal and of ethical judg?
But it should be observed that both the above statements refer in their form to the motion as a whole, while Newtons law of motion provides an answer to the question : how does the state of motion of a mass-point behave in an infinitely short time under the influence of an external force ? But it too should have the bomb far the sole pur? But it was Planck's Jaw of radiation tbat yielded tbe first exact determina? But it will be necessarily finite. But it will be shown that none of the forms hitherto assumed for these equations can exactly fit in with this principle.
But it will be shown that this is not the case for the general equations which Lorentz has for any possible, and also for magnetic bodies ; but this is approximately the case (if neglect the square of the velocity of matter in comparison to the velocity of light) for those equations which Lorentz here- after infers for non-magnetic bodies. But it will hardly be possible, I think, to assign fundamental significance to this objection. But it will tell us the probability of meeting the electron on a particular spot, or where we have the greatest chance of meeting an electron. But it would be erroneous to believe that this step indicates a partial abandonment of the generai postulate of relativity.
But it would be of the great- est service to us all were you to present the problem of world peace in the light of your most recent discoveries, for such a presentation well might blaze the trail for new and fruitful modes of action. But it would be unjust to consider that the new field view freed science from the errors of the old theory of electric fluids or that the new theory destroys the achievements of the old. But it would not have been worth my while to write anything about my school life, and stil! But it would not have been worth my while to write anything about my school life, still less would I have liked to be responsible for anyone's printing or actually reading it. But its generalization goes far beyond these simple examples.
But its practical results agree so nearly with those of Newton's theory that it is difficult to find criteria for distinguishing them which are accessible to expe- rience. But its very success gave rise to a host of new questions all bearing on the central problem of relative motion of ether and matter. But laws alone cannot secure freedom of expression; in order that every man may present his views without penalty there must be a spirit of tolerance in the entire population. But laws alone cannot secure freedom of expression; in order that every man may present his views without penalty, there must be a spirit of tolerance in the entire population.
But let either mass, as judged by an observer at rest relatively to the other mass, rotate with constant angular velocity about the line joining the masses. But let us leave this question for the time being and accept Copernicus' point of view. But let us make up our minds to be cautious and try to give rigorous definitions, as we know how dangerous it is to over-estimate intuition. But light passes through a vacuum, whereas sound does not. But many others, equally convincing, could be quoted.
But meanwhile enunciation of the Principle in a rigid manner does not signify any contradiction to the hypotheses of Lorentz's molecular theory, but it shall become clear that the assumption of the contraction of the electron in Lorentz^s theory must be introduced* at an earlier stage than Lorentz has actually dene. But mere thinking cannot give us a sense of the ultimate and fundamental ends. But more than one line appears in the spectra of the elements, as a rule. But my imagination can not picture the maker of that pattern. But my purpose bere is to present the fundamental connexions in as perspicuous a manner as possible, and in as generai terms as is pera missible from tbe point of view of the generai theory of rela.tivity. But nature cares very little for our limitations.
But neither Max- well nor his successors succeeded in thinking out a mechanical model for the ether capable of providing a satisfactory mechanical interpretation of Maxweirs laws of the electro-dynamic field. But neither Maxwell nor his followers succeeded in elaborating a mechanical model for the ether which might furnish a satisfactory mechanical interpretation of Maxwells laws of the electro-magnetic field. But never, on any previous occasion, has the pain so far outweighed the pleasure as now. But nevertheless, even in questions as to the constitution of elementary particles, it retains part of its importance. But no logical investigation can reveal this connection; it can only be experienced.
But no method existed by which this kind of field equations could be discovered without deteriorating into adventurous arbitrariness. But no person whose mode of thought is logical can rest satisfied with this condition of things. But no such change had taken place; for I found, upon taking equal quantities, by weight, of these chips, and of thin slips of the same block of metal separated by means of a fine saw and putting them, at the same temperature (that of boiling water), into equal quantities of cold water (that is to say, at the temperature of 59^ F.) the portion of water into which the chips were put was not, to all appearance, heated either less or more than the other portion, in which the slips of metal were put. But no such difference is detected!
But no trace of such an effect has ever been found. But nothing has been done to avert war, while much has been done to make atomic war more horriblea so there is no excuse for ignoring the danger. ' But nothing should be too obvious; if we wish to be really careful, we should analyse the assumptions, so far taken for granted, in physics. But now I ask: Is there really any physicist who believes that we shall never get any inside view of these important alterations in the single systems, in their structure and their causa! But now imagine that for a time which may be as short as a fraction of a second the motions of the two men are not the same. But now let us divide the metal rod into its two separate parts and then take away the rubber rod. But now let us join the wire to the zinc plate.
But now let us take two such plates and place both of them between our eyes and the light. But now the agent also acts as an interpreter, one who translates the laws into a simple, clear language, easily understood. But now, without any provocation, and without the justi:fication of reprisal or retaliation, a refusal to outlaw the use of the bomb save in reprisal is making a politica !purpose of its possession. But of one thing I feel sure : if the types we have just expelled were the only types there were, ihe temple would never have existed, any more than one can have a wood consisting of nothing but creepers.
But on one point, curiously enough, there was failure: it proved impossible to associate with these Schrodinger waves definite motions of the mass points-and that, af ter all, had been the origina!purpose of the whole construction. But on the basis of the theory of relativity the method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. But on the other band, there are decisive weaknesses attached to this idea in itself, which have been painfully felt since the beginning of history. But on the other hand there is a weighty argument to be adduced in favour of the ether hypothesis. But one can convince oneself that the definitions of time and the form of moving objects require the introduction of clocks at rest in the reference frame under consideration.
But one cannot know in advance what would be the effect on Russian fears if the American people forced their leaders to pursue a policy of substituting law for the present anarchy of international relations. But one must avoid the prejudice that regards the religions of primitive peoples as pure fear religions and those of the civilized races as pure moral religions. But one must not legalize the mentioned sin so far as to imagine that inter- vals are physical entities of a special type, intrinsically different from other physical variables ("reducing physics to geometry," etc.). But one shrinks from the use of such words, for one soon gets into difficulties when one has to explain what is really meant by reality' and by comprehend in such a general statement.
But other countries which have the materials and the men and care to apply them to the work of developing atomic power can do so, for men and materials and the decision to use them, and not money, are all that are needed. But our conclusions are generally valid, and can be sum- marized as follows : (1) We know of no rule for finding an inertial system. But our construction of squares must necessarily come into disorder during the heating, because the little rods on the central region of the table expand, whereas those on the outer part do not. But our final aim is always a better understanding of reality. But our representation had to be simple. But our wretched position has proved beneficial to us.
But patriotism is no excuse for any group of men to assail its neighbors or to impress its point of view upon others by fire and sword. But perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if some one were to ask you: "What, then, do you mean by the assertion that these propositions are true?" But physical space and time is completely defined by the ' framework." But physics assures us that the greenness of grass, the bardness of stones, and the coldness of snmv are not the greenness, hardness, and coldness that we know in ouT own experience, but something very different.
But physics assures us that the greenness of grass, the hardness of stones, and the coldness of snow, are not the greenness, hardness, and coldness that we know in our own experience, but something very different. But quite apart from the question of comparative merits, the fictitious character of the principles is made quite obvious by the fact that it is possible to exhibit two essentially different bases, each of which in its consequences leads to a large measure of agreement with experience.
But quite apart from the question of the superiority of one or the other, the fictitious character of funda- mental principles is perfectly evident from the fact that we can point to two essentially different prin- ciples, both of which correspond with experience to a large extent; this proves at the same time that every attempt at a logical deduction of the basic con- cepts and postulates of mechanics from elementary experiences is doomed to fajlure. But recognition of this obvious fact is merely the first step towards an appre- ciation of the actual state of affairs. But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspira? But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and un?
But science in the making, science as an end to be pursued, is as subjective and psychologically conditioned as any other branch of human* endeavor so much so that the question, What is Ae purpose and meaning of science ? But science must create its own language, its own con- cepts, for its own use. But science, if it is to flourish, must have no practical end in view. But should France frame demands in accordance with this, such a step would certainly be taken very ill in Germany. But should not an effort in this direction be risked in spite of this? But simple calculation shows that, for a wavelength of 0.5 m and an absolute temperature T = 1700 K, / E is not only not small compared to one, but is very big compared to one; the value is approximately 6.5 x 107.
But since in daily experience the weight of bodies meets us as something constant, something not linked to any cause which is variable in time or place, we do not in everyday life speculate as to the cause of gravity, and therefore do not become conscious of its character as action at a distance. But since the ^-axis can be laid in the direction of any time-like axis, therefore the energy-law comprises, for any possible system of reference, the whoL.^ system of equations of motion. But since the gravity of bodies presents itself to us in common life as something constant, dependent on no variable temporal or spatial cause, we do not ordinarily think of any cause in connection with it and thus are not conscious of its character as a force acting at a dis- tance.
But since there are other things which are not influenced in a similar manner to the little rods (or perhaps not at all) by the temperature of the table, it is possible quite naturally to maintain the point of view that the marble slab is a " Euclidean continuum." But since there is little hope of obtaining an answer different from the above, let us try to gain some concrete information by changing the question: "Is a c.s. But so far, we have not succeeded in fulfilling this programme. But so is the lift, with its walls, ceiling, and floor. But some difficulty arises if the observers of two systems begin to discuss observations of the same event from the point of view of their different c.s. But speculations on the structure of the universe also move in quite another direction.
But still another essential step is necessary. But such a rapid change, however it is produced, must create an induced current. But such a view is inconsistent with the fundamental facts of mechanics. But such an association has this defect^it depends on the position of the observer provided with the clock, as we know by experience. But t this, after all, is scant information. But taken as a whole, the present day economy does not diHer much from "pure" capitalism. But taken as a whole, the present day economy does not differ much from "pure" capitalism.Production is carried on for profit, not for use. But that a principle of such broad generality should hold with such exactness in one domain of phenomena, and yet should be invalid for another, is a priori not very probable.
But that artifice is not available in four dimensions. But that does not mean that individuality should be destroyed and the indi? But that does not mean that individuality should be destroyed and the individuai become a mere tool of the community, like a bee or an ant. But that is not the case for the elementary processes of radiation. But the Big Three should go ahead and organize the world government, whether the smaller nations join or not. But the Gaussian method can be applied also to a continuum of three, four or more dimensions. But the Jewish tradition also contains something else, something which finds splendid expression in many of the Psalms namely, a sort of intoxicated joy and amazement at the beauty and grandeur of this world, of which, man can just form a faint notion.
But the League is not much more than a meeting-hall, and the Court has no means of enforcing its decisions. But the acceleration which figures in Newtons equations of motion is unintelligible if one starts with the con- cept of relative motion. But the aim of every physical theory still remains the same. But the appearance of the crisis in the United States, in spite of the high tariff-wall protecting them, proves that this cannot be the principal cause of the world crisis. But the appearance of the crisis in the United States, in spite of the high tariff-wall, proves that this cannot be the principal cause of the world crisis. But the assimilative power of the human intellect is and remains strictly limited. But the attempts were super:ficial and bore no fruit.
But the calamities of our times show us that this was a fatal illusion. But the ceaseless piling-up of armaments shows only too clearly that they are unequal to coping with the hostile forces which are preparing for war. But the chief point is that Zionism must tend to strengthen the dignity and self- respect of Jews in Diaspora. But the clearing away of obstacles does not by itself lead to an ennoblement of social and individua! But the co-ordinates and velocities are dif- ferent, and change according to the transformation laws.
But the concept of space was not arrived at, either by Einstein or Lorentz, probably because in the case of th^ above- mentioned spatial transformations, where the ( </, /') plane coincides with the '-/ plane, the significance is possible that the -^-axis of space some-how remains conserved in its position. But the conception though a very fruitful one, long remained without a trace of experimental proof, though after the discovery of the electron, it was srenerallv believed that these molecular currents may be due to the rotational motion of free electrons within the metal. But the considerations of Sections 25 and 26 show us the way to surmount this difficulty. But the corresponding number for the lower rod will change. But the creation of fear only heightens antagonism and in?
But the creative principle resides in mathematics. But the definition is not sufficient when it is required to connect by time events taking place at different stations, or what amounts to the same thing,-to estimate by means of time (zeitlich werten) the occurrence of events, which take place at stations distant from the clock. But the development of machinery means that less and less work is needed from the individual for the satisfaction of the community's needs. But the development of technology means that less and less work is needed from the individuai for the satisfaction of the co=u? But the difficulties in solving this problem are so great that we have to give it up and thus give up the mechanical views as well. But the distance travelled with respect to the platform is always 21.
But the elementary laws certainly cannot be formulated by 296 THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS specifying positions and velocities at any instant in the simple manner of classical mechanics. But the ends themselves are conceived by personalities with lofty ethical ideals and-if these ends are not stillborn, but vital and vigorous-are adopted and carried forward by those many human beings who, haH unconsciously, determine the slow evolution of society.
But the ends themselves are conceived by personalities with lofty ethical ideals andNif these ends are not stillborn, but vital and vigorousNare adopted and carried forward by those many human beings who, half unconsciously, determine the slow evolution of society.For these reasons, we should be on our guard not to overestimate science and scientific methods when it is a question of human problems; and we should not assume that experts are the only ones who have a right to express themselves on questions affecting the organization of society. But the enormous practical success of his theory may well have prevented him and the physicists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries from recognizing the fictitious character of the principles of his system.
But the ether hypothesis was bound always to play a part, even if it was mostly a latent one at first in the thinking of physicists. But the ether hypothesis was bound always to play some part in physical science, even if at first only a latent part. But the events A and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. But the experiment gave a negative result N a fact very perplexing to physicists. But the force, instead of depending only upon distance, depends also upon the velocity of the charge. But the framing of these propositions will re- main an empty word-game for him, as long as point, straight-line, plane, etc., convey nothing to him. But the free play of economic forces will not by itself automatically overcome these difficulties.
But the general theory of relativity permits of our answering it with a moduate degree of certainty, and in this connection the difficulty mentioned in Section 30 finds its solution. But the idea of formulating this problem is suggested by the use of the field language. But the idea that there were two structures of space independent of each other, the metric-gravitational and the electro-magnetic, was intolerable to the theoretical spirit. But the importance of Newtons achievement was not confined to the fact that it created a workable and logically satisfactory basis for the actual science of mechanics; up to the end of the nineteenth century it formed the program of every worker in the field of theoretical physics.
But the invariant ds always exists for two neighbouring points (events) of the continuum. But the led must not be coerced, they must be able to choose their leader. But the led must not be compelled, they must be able to choose their leader. But the meaning of physical concepts determined by these equations of quantum physics is much more abstract than in the case of electromagnetic and gravitational fields; they provide only the mathematical means of answering questions of a statistical nature. But the mechanical view broke down. But the metre-rod is moving with the velocity v relative to K. It therefore follows that the length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the direction of its length with a velocity v is of a metre. But the moment another country is able to make it in sub?
But the more precise de- velopment of the mechanics of discrete masses, as the basis of all physics, was the achievement of the nine- teenth century. But the most attractive problem, to the solution of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key, concerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational field itself. But the most recent reports show that the world, and especially the British Government, is disposed to recognize the great things which lie behind our struggle for the Zionist ideal. But the motion of this charged sphere is, as we already know from Rowland's experiment, equivalent to a current.
But the new formulation has this great advantage, that the quantity E appears in the fundamental equations as a constant of integration, and no longer as a universal constant peculiar to the fundamental law. But the number of great men has decreased out of all proportion. But the number of leading personali? But the old physics, including the laws of motion of Galileo and Newton, did not fit in with the sug- gested relativist kinematics. But the other pillar of the field theory, based on Oersted's experiment, must be con- sidered just as carefully and in a similar manner. But the outside observer will notice the motion of the room, and, therefore, that of the source and, since the ether is carried along, his con- clusion must be: the velocity of light in my outside c.s.
But the path was thornier than one might suppose, because it demanded the abandonment of Euclidean geometry. But the personality that finally emerges is largely formed by the environment in which a man happens to find himself during his development, by the structure of the society in which he grows up, by the tradition of that society, and by its appraisal of particular types of behavior. But the personality that fnally emerges is largely formed by the environment in which a man happens to fnd himself during his development, by the structure of the society in which he grows up, by the tradition of that society, and by its appraisal of particular types of behavior.
But the phenomena revealing the particle and wave nature of matter and radiation, the apparently statistical character of elementary events such as radioactive dis- integration, diffraction, emission of spectral lines, and many others, forced us to give up this view. But the physicists were still far removed from such a way of thinking ; space was still, for them, a rigid, homogeneous something, susceptible of no change or conditions. But the point from which we started out still exists and can be seen, although it appears smaller and forms a tiny part of our broad view gained by the mastery of the obstacles on our adventurous way up. But the position must always be described with respect to something, as in the previous case to the tower and the scale.
But the price paid for this simplicity is high: the introduction of new weightless substances. But the privileged space R1 of Galileo, thus introduced, is a merely f actitious cause, and not a thing that can be observed. But the pursuit of scientific truth, detached from the practical interests of everyday !ife, ought to be treated as sacred by every govern? But the pursuit of scientific truth, detached from the practical interests of everyday life, ought to be treated as sacred by every Government, and it is in the highest interests of all that honest servants of truth should be left in peace. But the ray moves relatively to the initial point of k, when measured in the stationary system, with the velocity c ? But the relativity theory changes this view.
But the relativity theory claims that all laws of nature must be invariant with respect to the Lorentz and not to the classical transformation. But the result of actually breaking a magnet is sur- prising and unexpected. But the result was significant and impor- tant. But the rotation of the earth is comparatively slow, so that the effect is not very dis- tinct. But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causa? But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation. But the series of waves created by the oscillation continues to spread.
But the special role of the fundamental tensor in our Theory, which has its physical basis on the particularly exceptional character of gravita- tion makes it clear that those relations are to be developed which will be required only in the case of the fundamental tensor. But the spherical-surface beings do not need to go on a world-tour in order to perceive that they are not living in a Euclidean universe. But the story of the search for a theory of light is by no means finished. But the strongest reason for the choice of these equations lies in their consequence, tbat the equations of conservation of momentum and energy, corresponding exactly to equations (49) and (49a), hold good for tbe components of the total energy.
But the structure of the spectra, which was to a large extent known empirically, was so profoundly different from what was to be expected on our older theories that nobody could find a convincing theoretical inter- pretation of the observed uniformities. But the students at ouT universities have ceased as completely as their teachers to em? But the students at our universities have ceased as completely as their teachers to enshrine the hopes and ideals of the nation. But the survival of Europe depends on its successful issue. But the technical advances of our times have turned this ethical postulate into a matter of life and death for civilized mankind to-day, and made the taking of an active part in the solution of the problem of peace a moral duty which no conscientious man can shirk.
But the theory that shall interpret them is man-made. But the thermometer was for a few minutes in contact with my P^ientjjojhat bothjjatient and thermometer havef the Tame temperature. But the time, in which the field appears as static, is not measured by equally constituted stationary clocks. But the tremendous practical success of his doctrines may well have pre- vented him and the physicists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries from recognizing the fictitious character of the foundations of his system. But the unsatisfactory results of their efforts led to gradual acceptance of the new field concepts as irreducible fundamentals-in other words, physicists resigned themselves to giving up the idea of a mechanical foundation.
But the very farmulation of this idea makes it obvious to what extent such a concept contradicts our sense of justice. But the way was harder :fuan was expected, because it contradicted Eu? But the whole pheno- menon is astonishing from the standpoint of energy. But the whole voltaic battery forms an isolated system, since no external energy is being supplied. But the work of statesmen can succeed only if they are backed by the serious and determined will of the people. But the years of anxious searching in the dark, with their intense longing, their alternations of confidence and exhaustion, and the final emergence into the light; only those who have experienced it can understand that.
But then the effect should be exactly as in the first case, light and dark rings and not light and dark stripes. But there are certain necessary conditions wbich can be met. But there are other and simpler objections to ether than the difficulty of constructing it. But there are plenty of the well-endowed ones too, thank God, and I am firmly convinced that most of them live quiet, unregarded lives. But there are plenty of the well-endowed, thank God, and I am firmly convinced that most of them Jive quiet, unob- , trusive Jives. But there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained which can be represented in the Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in itself N i.e. But there are two serious criticisms of the ordinary conception.
But there is a difference between the uniform motion be- fore and after the action of the force : the direction is changed. But there is a third stage of religious experience which belongs to ali of them, even though it is rarely found in a pure form: I shall call it cosmic religious feeling. But there is a third state of religious experience which belongs to all of them, even though it is rarely found in a pure form, and which I will call cosmic religious feeling. But there is also no doubt that quantum physics must still be based on the two concepts: matter and field. But there is also such a thing as a spirit of the times, an attitude of mind characteristic of a particular generation, which is passed on from individuai to individual and gives its distinctive mark to a society.
But there is also such a thing as a spirit of the times, an attitude of mind characteristic of a particular generation, which is passed on from individual to individual and gives a society its particular tone. But there is another reason for the high repute of mathematics, in that it is mathematics which affords the exact natural sciences a certain measure of security, to which without mathematics they could not attain. But there is another respect in which he resembles the Asiatic more than the European does: he is lest of an individualist than the European that is, from the psychological, not the economic, point of view. But there is another road, which seems to me more practicable, although it also presents great difficulties.
But there is no doubt that the future study of optical and perhaps other phenomena will reveal its structure. But there is no indication as to the truth of these conclusions. But there is no reason to discuss the more complicated assumptions before finding out which of the two simpler limiting cases experiment favours. But there is no reason why we should look upon the Galilean system as more fundamental than any other. But there is no way in which this concept could be made to grow, as it were, directly out of sense experiences. But there is no way of foreseeing when and where the clarification of these difficulties will be brought about. But there is one essential difference.
But there is one respect in which he resembles the Asiatic more than the European does: he is less of an individualist than the European-that is, from the psychological, not the eco? But there is still another aspect of this problem. But there is still one essential difference between mechanical laws and Maxwell's laws. But there is the additional fact that this process of economie concentra? But there is yet another difficulty. But there was inherent in this theory a peculiar complexity of the fundamental principles which prevented its essential features from revealing themselves distinct!y. But therewith the conception of the ether has again acquired an intelligible content, although this content differs widely from that of the ether of the mechanical undulatory theory of light.
But these attempts receded gradually to the background following the representation-purged of any unnecessary additions - by Heinrich Hertz, so that, in this theory the field .6.nally took the fundamental position which had been occupied in Newton's mechanics by the materia!points. But these centrifuga!forces are, like gravitation, pro? But these centrifugal forces are, exactly like the forces of gravity, proportional to the masses of the bodies. But these concepts serve the purpose of bringing a multiplicity of real or imaginary sensory experiences into connection in the mind. But these mechanical velocities are all very small compared to that of light, and it is, therefore, ridiculous to apply relativity to these phenomena.
But these spheres are not to be rigid in the sense of Euclidean geometry; their radius is to increase (in the sense of Euclidean geometry) when they are moved away from S towards infinity, and this increase is to take place in exact accordance with the same law as applies to the increase of the radii of the disc-shadows L' on the plane. But these spheres are not to be rigid in the sense of Euclidean geometry; their radius is to increase (in the sense of Euclidean geometry) when they are moved away from S towards infinity, and this increase is to take place in exact accordance with the same law as applies to the increase of the radii of the discshadows L' on the plane. But they are by no means arbitrary from a psycho?
But they are not logical enough to make vigorous efforts on behalf of the measures which might prevent war, that savage and unworthy relic of the age of barbarism. But they are relative in so far as they depend on the state of motion of the selected inertial system. But they have little influence on the course of political events. But this analogy must not be pushed too far. But this analysis shows how many hidden assumptions there are in every one of our state- FIELD, RELATIVITY 163 ments.
But this assumption is certainly warranted by experience; if it did not hold there could be no sharp spectral lines, since the single atoms of the same element certainly do not have the same history, and since?on the assumption of relative variability of the single atoms depending on previous history?it would be absurd to suppose that the masses or proper frequencies of these atoms ever had been equal to one another. But this attempt to found relativity of translation upon the Galilean transformation fails when applied to electromagnetic phenomena. But this chain of creation can be traced back far beyond the starting point of physics. But this change led to a fundamental dualism which in the long-run was insupportable.
But this choice has its justification in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, the sphere is unique in possessing the property that all points on it are equivalent. But this co-ordination has the disadvantage that it is not independent of the standpoint of the observer with the watch or clock, as we know from experience. But this conception of the ether to which we are led by Machs way of thinking differs essentially from the ether as conceived by Newton, by Fresnel, and by Lorentz. But this condition goes too far. But this condition is clearly one which goes too far.. For it is clear that the o^ravitati on -field srenerated bv a material point in its own neighbourhood can never be transformed aivai/ by any choice of axes, i.e., it cannot be transformed to a case of constant g 's.
But this conviction does not rest on the supposition that anyone haactually proved the impossibility of gaining knowledge of reality by means of pure speculation, but rather upon the fact that the empirical (in the above mentioned sense) procedure alone has shown its capacity to be the source of knowledge. But this conviction does not rest on the supposition that anyone has actually proved the impossibility of gaining knowledge of reality by means of pure speculation, but rather upon the fact that the empirica! But this country has been solemnly invited to renounce the use of the bomb-that is, to outlaw it-and has declined to do so unless its terms far supranational contro!are accepted.
But this ether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. But this ether must not be thought of as endowed with the properties characteristic of ponderable media, as composed of particles the mo- tion of which can be followed; nor may the concept of motion be applied to it Science as something existing and complete is the most objective thing known to man.
But this expression represents the whole of the average momentum transferred per unit time to a molecule moving with velocity v. For it it clear that the elementary radiative emission processes, which take place in K' without interaction with the radiation field, have no preferred direction, so that they cannot transmit any momentum to the molecule, on average. But this gift also brings with it dangers to our existence as great as any that have ever threatened it. But this has also once more given the ether notion a definite content ^though one very different from that of the ether of the mechanical wave-theory of light. But this has made the problem of the division of labour and the distribution of the goods produced far more difficult.
But this is a purely quali- tative criterion, not sufficient for a quantitative descrip- tion and sometimes even ambiguous. But this is another story, and we shall tell it later. But this is not the case: all bodies fall in the same way. But this is not the first time we have faced a difficulty of this kind in physics. But this is not the only possible answer. But this is only the simplest kind of a standing wave. But this is the common fate of all who have adopted a world of ideas as their dwelling-place. But this is unneces- sary, since the movements of the single particles are mutually independent. But this is wrong, becausc man owes his strength in the struggle far existence to the fact that he is a socially living animal.
But this is wrong, because man owes his strength in the struggle for existence to the fact that he is a socially living animai. But this knowledge of the gravitational force alone is not sufficient for a description of the motion of the planets. But this latter accordance with the Relativity Principle is due to the fact that the condition of non-mag^netisation has been formula- ted in a way not corresponding to the Relativity Principle; therefore the accordance is due to the fortuitous compensa- tion of two contradictions to the Relalivity-Postulate. But this law does not fit the frame of special relativity. But this mechanical theory of the ether was never quite successful and so the idea of a closer explanation of the nature of the etheric fields was given up.
But this objection relates more to the form than to the real essence of the matter. But this observer will refer the distance to his c.s. But this occurs only in the direction of the motion. But this point of view by no means embraces the whole of the actual process ; for it slurs over the important part played by intuition and deductive thought in the development of an exact science. But this relativity had no rTMle in building up the theory. But this restriction is not sufficient to determine the generalization uniquely. But this result must not contra- dict those results previously obtained. But this security is purchased at the price of empti- ness of content.
But this should be done by someone who, from bis youth, has been connected with this State and is familiar with its past, not by one who like a gypsy has wandered about and gathered his experiences in all kinds of countries. But this should be done by someone who, from his youth, has been connected with this State and is familiar with its past, not by one wbo like a gypsy has wandered about and gathered his experiences in ali kinds of countries. But this transformation law is in contradiction to the constant character of the velocity of light. But this understanding becomes fruitful only when it is sustained. But this very bitterness has done us good.
But this view of the universe necessitated an extension of equations (1), with the introd uction of a new universal constant E., standing in a fixed relation to the tota! But this was not of much use, as it was still not known how the distance from the earth to the sun alters in the course of the year. But this was not very convenient, because we had to take all measurements in the vicinity of this one clock. But this would not be a good proof. But thought and ideas, not formulae, are the beginning of every physical theory. But thus withdrawn far long periods from the will-hardening discipline of normal work and a prey to morbid reflection on his physical condition, he easily loses his mental resilience, the sense of being able to hold his own in the struggle far existence.
But thus withdrawn for long periods from the will-hardening discipline of normal work and a prey to morbid reflection on his physical condition, he easily loses the power of mental effort and the sense of being able to hold his own in the struggle for existence. But to be called to account publicly for what others have said in one's name, when one cannot defend oneself, is indeed a sad predicament. But to connect every instant of time with a number, by the use of a clock, to regard time as a one-dimensional continuum, is already an invention. But to dis- cover some essential common features, hidden beneath a surface of external differences, to form, on this basis, a new successful theory, is important creative work.
But to perceive clearlv that the time of an electron is as ijood as the time of any other electron, i,e. But to show that the time interval between two events is 10 seconds, a clock is needed. But to that end we still need afo ap? But to the serious student of science, he has been known from the beffinnino* of the current century, and many dark problems in physics has been illuminated with the lustre of his genius, before, owing to the latest sensation just mentioned, he flashes out before public imagination as a scientific star of the first magnitude. But to tire in that struggle would mean the ruin of society.
But unfortunately it forces us to employ a continuum of which the number of dimensions is not that of previous physics, namely 4, but which has dimensions increasing without limit as the number of the particles constituting the system under examination increases. But until this goal is reached there is no greater satisfaction for a just and well? But war is not like a parlour-game in which the players loyally stick to the rules. But we already know that covering the QUANTA 397 second hole does make a difference. But we also know the direc- tion of SE in relation to the fixed stars through direct solar observations, while the direction of the line SM in relation to the fixed stars was finally ascertained previously. But we also learned about some objections to the old theory.
But we can assert by reason of the relativistic equations of gravitation that there must be a departure from Euclidean relations, with spaces of cosmic order of magnitude, if there exists a positive mean density, no matter how small, of the matter in the universe. But we can complement dx so that it becomes an invariant. But we can equally well imagine the opposite: that the room travels through the ether as a ship through a perfectly smooth sea, not carrying any part of the medium along but moving through it. But we can free ourselves from both of these limitations without altering the nature of our specification of position. But we can picture the same motion in a different way. But we cannot answer this question; the finding of the proper solution must be left to the others.
But we cannot do this when speaking of the photoelectric effect, intensity of spec- tral lines, radioactivity, diffraction of electric waves and many other phenomena in which the quantum character of matter and energy is revealed. But we cannot foretell whether the car which will pass in the next moment will have this property. But we could none the less call it a medium. But we do know these laws with respect to the inertial system K, and we can therefore infer their form with respect to K'. But we do not immediately see how we can apply them to motion along a curved path. But we do not know the laws which govern the currents and charges. But we easily convince ourselves that this extension vanishes identically. But we have a still better consolation.
But we have a still fairer consolation. But we have already allowed ourselves to be convinced that the classical transformation must not be used in physics generally. But we have just seen that this assumption is incompatible with the most natural definition of simultaneity; if we discard this assumption, then the conflict between the law of the propagation of light in vacuo and the principle of relativity (developed in Section 7) disappears. But we may also base our reflexions on the equations (9). But we may also make the following assertion : If AvB" is a. scalar for any choice of the tensor B", then Av has tensor character. But we may as well apply the new theory, since all the known facts are contained in the realm of its validity.
But we may ask: "How many particles have a speed between 1000 and uoo feet per second?" But we must make it clear as quickly as possible that we are not keeping the bomb a secret for the sake of our power, but in the hope of establishing peace through a world government, and we will do our utmost to bring this world government into being. But we must never forget what this crisis has taught us namely, that the establishment of satisfactory relations between the Jews and the Arabs is not England's affair but ours. But we must remember that this division into time and space has no objective meaning since time is no longer "absolute". But we realize that in spite of all the volumes read and understood we are still far from a complete solution, if, indeed, such a thing exists at all.
But we remember the all-important field concept in classical physics. But we shall not contradict any of the explanations of the optical facts by also assuming that the light wave is an electromagnetic one. But we shall now show that we must put it aside and replace it by a more generai view, in order to be able to carry tbrough the postulate of generai relativity, if the special theory of relati-vity applies to tbe special case of tbe absence of a gravi- tational field. But we shall see that just this strange language leads to an important generalization in which vectors appear to be essential. But we wish to show that we are to abandon it and in ireneral to replace it by more general conceptions in order to be. But what I feel when I think of H. A. Lorentz is far more than that.
But what about the case of not one but two interacting particles, for instance, two electrons, electron and photon, or electron and nucleus? But what about the two pinholes? But what can be the attraction of getting to know such a tiny section of nature thoroughly, while one leaves every- thing subtler and more complex shyly and timidly alone? But what happens if the experiment is changed, if previously the cart was empty and now it is loaded? But what happens when friction stops the pendulum? But what has this wave process to do with the first object of our interest, the particle originally enclosed in G? But what if the two-foot rule were to behave on the plane E in the same way as the disc-shadows L' ?
But what if the two-foot rule were to behave on the plane E in the same way as the disc-shadows L'? But what is gained in onZ way is lost in another. But what is the medium through which light spreads and what are its mechanical properties? But what is the origin of such ethical axioms? But what of the second experiment? But what seems to be true is that the Soviet leaders believe they cannot preserve the social structure of the Soviet state in a supranational regime. But when I had started reading, I became so fascinated that the extemal occa? But when I occasionally tried to teli something about his spiritual personality, I realized painfully that I was not ac?
But when Lorentz is in the presidential chair, an atmospbere of happy cooperation is invariably created, however much those present may differ in their aims and babits of thougbt. But when asking myself what religion is I cannot think of the answer so easily. But when he is talking about tlT^piu^j^fo^iTafid aims of science, he should be permitted to speak of himself ; for a man experiences no aims and desires so im- mediately as his own. But when the experiment was tried, it was found that both parts of the beam took the same time, as tested by the interference bands produced."
But when this inter- pretation refused to work in spite of the most ob- stinate efforts, people gradually got used to the idea of regarding the electro-piagnetic field" as the final irreducible constituent of physical reality. But when we remember that the Special Theory is explicitly restricted to the case of unaecelerated motion, the difficulty vanishes. But where does intuition go wrong? But whereas a building may be seriously damaged by a heavy storm or spring flood, yet its foundations remain intact, in science the logical foundation is always in greater peril from new experiences or new knowledge than are athe branch disciplines with their closer experimental con?
But while the process of perfecting the field-theory was still in full swing, the facts of heat- radiation, the spectra, radio-activity, etc., revealed a limit to the serviceableness of the whole intellectual system which today still seems to us absolutely in- superable in spite of immense successes at certain points. But whoever has undergone the intense experience of successful advances made in this domain is moved by pro? But whoever has undergone the intense experience of successful advances made in this domain, is moved by profound reverence for the rationality made mani? But with our growing self-consciousness and increasing intelligence we must begin to control tradition and assume a criticai attitude toward it, if human relations are ever to change for the better.
But without deeper reflection one knows from dai!y!ife that one exists far other people? But without further premises, it is not possible to compare, as far as time is concerned, the events at B with the events at A. But yet the time was not ripe for a science that could comprehend reality, was not ripe until a second elementary truth had been realized, which only became the common property of philosophers after Kepler and Galileo. But you soon discover that there is no escape. But you would then have to protest just as strongly against all the graphs representing, for example, the change of temperature in New York City during last summer, or against those representing the changes in the cost of living during the last few years, since the very same method is used in each of these cases.
But, according to the foregoing considerations, the time required by a particular occurrence with respect to the carriage must not be considered equal to the duration of the same occurrence as judged from the embankment (as reference-body). But, according to the principle of equivalence, K' may also be considered as a system at rest, with respect to which there is a gravitational field (field of centrifugal force, and force of Coriolis). But, ali in all, one felt at home with it and, apart from the many kinds of accidents, comparatively safe in it. But, as motion with infinite speed cannot mean much to any reasonable person, an attempt to make our drawing something more than a model leads nowhere. But, as we have seen, both wave functions P), and q, belong to the same reality.
But, from our above consideration, this would appear to be impossible. But, if one goes on to ask who they are, one finds oneself in no inconsiderable difficulties. But, if the rods move uniformly, relative to each other, the numbers corresponding to the positions will be different after some time, say, one second. But, if the train stops, or accelerates abruptly, or if the sea is rough, strange things happen. But, it is similar to a building, one wing of which is made of fine marble (left part of the equation ), but the other wing of which is built of low grade wood ( right side of equation ). But, on the other hand, I assert that the cosmic religious experience is the strongest and the noblest driving force behind scientific re search.
But, on the other hand, there are decisive weaknesses attached to this idea in itself, which have been painfully felt since the beginning of history. But, on the other hand, these results must strike you as being very singular, and for that reason I shall now draw another conclusion from the theory, one which can easily be derived from the foregoing considerations, and which has been most elegantly confirmed by experiment. But, to begin with, I don't believe it, and even if it were true, the above-mentioned factors would always operate to force the standard of living of a large portion of the human race doom to an unnaturally low level.
But, when Lorentz is in the presidential chair, an atmosphere of happy co-operation is invariably created, however much those present may differ in their aims and habits of thought. But, you will say, where did Kepler get his lantern M ? Butvit is essential that the two velocity vectors should be separated only by a "very short" time interval. By "over-production" people usually mean a condition in whicb more of one particular article is produced than can, in existing circumstances, be sold, in spite of a short? By "over-production" people usually mean a condition of things in which more of one particular article is produced than can, in existing circumstances, be sold, in spite of a shortage of consumption-goods among consumers.
By "remote field" I referred to the theoretical foundations of physics. By (26) the expressions A" - {u., T}A n uXu () - { uv, T}B,, uXu are tensors. By (67) and (68) the expression for the gravitational potential becomes _ . By F and / shall be understood the space time vectors of the second kind M i'E, vi ie. By I, we alwaj^s mean the time in the stationaiy system. By a continued repetition of this process the whole path of the motion may be traced without further recourse to observational data. By a cyclic interchange of the indices , n, ?, we obtain thus altogether three equations, from which we obtain, on taking into account the sym- metrical property of the ? By a known property of determinants gugvrr = o; (16) where the symbol o; denotes 1 or O, according as .
By a suitable choice of Cartesian coordinates this distance may be expressed by the formula ds dx dx . By a suitable choice of units we can thus make this ratio equal to unity. By adding (or subtracting) equations (3) and (4), and introducing for convenience the constants a and b in place of the constants _ and , where and we obtain the equations We should thus have the solution of our problem, if the constants a and b were known. By adding these, we have the tensor of the third rank A,...u = <>A" - {u., T}An - { uv, T}A,.., . By addition and subtraction of the corresponding, components of tensors of the same rank, a tensor of equal rank results: A??... By and by I des- paired of the possibility of discovering the true laws by means of construc- tive efforts based on known facts.
By applying the statistical method we cannot fore- tell the behaviour of an individual in a crowd. By breaking the glass rod in the case of the electric dipole we get two isolated poles. By carrying out the variation of the g,, and the q<Pl we obtain, as field-equations of gravitation and matter, the equations t (4) . By choosing one corner of a square as " origin" I can characterise every other corner of a square with reference to this origin by means of two numbers. By compar- ing the amounts obtained for the diffusion current from both types of reasoning one reaches quantitatively the statistical law for those displace- ments, i.e., the law of the Brownian motion. By comparison we obtain /C = ., = l87 X 10 - i7 (69) C" Behaviour of Rods and Clocks in the Static Gravi?
By contraction and multiplication by the scalar dt we obtain the equation of kinetic energy d ? By convention we regard the potential corresponding to a negative charge as lower than that corresponding to a positive charge. By creating a four-dimensional tensor-calculus he achieved the same thing for the four-dimensional space which the ordinary vector-calculus achieves for the three spatial dimen- sions. By cultivating these carefully we shall be able in future to prevent things from becoming so dangerously strained that people can take advantage of them to provoke acts of hostility. By differentiation of (18) with respect to x, and summation for v, there follows, in view of (17), () lx.,(X + t) = O (21).
By electing me to your Academy you have freed me from the distrac- tions and cares of a professional life and so made it possible for me to devote myself entirely to scientific studies. By equating the coefficients of both formulas one obtains (R/N)(81/L3) = (?/?) By equating the components, we obtain, in threedimensional notation, ? By examining the deflection of these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic fields, we can study the law of motion of these particles very exactly. By examining the laws of the formation of tensors, we acquire the means of formu? By following the right clue we achieve a deeper understanding of the problem of motion. By freedom I understand socia!
By furthering logical thought and a logical attitude, science can diminish the amount of superstition in the world. By giving such a testimony in the present circumstances I should have been contributing, even if only indirectly, to the barbarization of manners and the destruction of all existing cultural values. By heating we raise the temperature, and thus increase the energy. By ignoring gravitation, we automatically come back to the inertial c.s. By inserting the values of these constants in (5), we obtain the first and the fourth of the equations given in Section 11. By integration we obtain -x- B = / ] d x l . By interchanging the indices and subsequent subtraction, we obtain, after a simple transformation, the theorem of moments, d ? By introducing tbis into our ex?
By knowing the position and velocity of a particle at one single instant, by knowing the acting forces, the whole future path of the particle could be foreseen. By laying down the Relativity- Postulate from the outset, sufficient means have been created for deducing henceforth the complete series of Laws of Mechanics from the principle of conservation of Energy alone (the form of the Energy being given in explicit forms). By lightening their heavy lot as far as we can we shall be saving the most valuable sort of human life; for the first settlers' struggle on ground not yet made habitable is a difficult and dangerous business involving a heavy personal sacrifice. By limiting ourselves only to terms of the lowest order we get instead of (46)^ first, the equations : d^x = r .
By making use of the following modification of this abstract experiment, we recognise that there must also be cases in which the experiment would be unsuccessful. By mathematical deduction from Max- well's equations we can detect the character of the field surrounding an oscillating charge, its structure near and far from the source and its change with time. By means of a back-transformation to the stationary system, we obtain K, for the reflected light : 1+ - cos $" 1-2 - cos ^ + A'" = A" " =A ^ '- ^2 1 ^^ N V -s C2 C^' cos $'"= cos4>" + "^ ("H- '^^ cos 4>-2 !^ C \ ('''J c 1+ 1 .
By means of comparatively simple considerations we are led to draw the following conclusion from these premises, in conjunction with the fundamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell: A body moving with the velocity v, which absorbs 1) an amount of energy E0 in the form of radiation without suffering an alteration in velocity in the process, has, as a consequence, its energy increased by an amount In consideration of the expression given above for the kinetic energy of the body, the required energy of the body comes out to be Thus the body has the same energy as a body of mass moving with the velocity v. Hence we can say: If a body takes up an amount of energy E0, then its inertial mass increases by an amount the inertial mass of a body is not a constant but varies according to the change in the energy of the body.
By means of optical observations of the cloud from different positions on the ground, and taking into account the properties of the propagation of light, we determine the length of the pole we should have required in order to reach the cloud. By means of similar considerations based on observa- tions of double stars, the Dutch astronomer De Sitter was also able to show that the velocity of propagation of light cannot depend on the velocity of motion of the body emitting the light. By means of simple changes in position we can bring two bodies into contact. By means of the extension of the vector, we may easily define the " extension " of a covariant tensor of any rank.
By means of the fundamental tensor, instead of tensors with co-variant index character, we can introduce tensors with contra-variant index character, and conversely. By means of the theory of relativity they have been united into one law. By means of these connec tions, the purely conceptual propositions Connecting them. By means of these connections, the purely notional theorems of science become statements about complexes of sense experiences. By means of these two relations and (18), we can write (14') in the form QV, <P') = [(Qh + YV' cos f' ( 5 " ) J ( ! By means of this relation the spherical beings can determine the radius of their universe (" world "), even when only a relatively small part of their worldsphere is available for their measurements.
By measuring along the rails, the connecting line AB should be measured up and an observer placed at the mid-point M of the distance AB. By mechanical experiments he could even ascertain how it rotates. By multiplication of the field equations (47) by gvr; these are obtained in the " mixed " form. By multiplying the iield-equations (47) with g , these are obtained in the mixed forms. By observing the registration plates of a great many cars we can soon discover that one-third of their num- bers are divisible by three. By outer multiplication and one contraction, we obtain from Av and B"T the mixed tensor of the second rank n; = AvB"'. By painful experience we have learnt that rational thinking does not suffice t solve the problems of our socia!life.
By performing the variation with respect to the variables psr one finds that, with suitable choice of the constants ?s, A, and B, ? By postulating some hypotheses on the emission and absorption of radiation by molecules, which suggested themselves from quantum theory, I was able to show that molecules with a quantum-theoretical distribution of states in thermal equilibrium, were in dynamical equilibrium with the Planck radiation; in this way, Planck's formula (4) could be derived in an astonishingly simple and general way. By real over-production I mean a production so great that it exceeds ' the demand. By real overproduction I mean a production so great that it exceeds the demand.
By reason of our past experience, you would certainly regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the most out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue. By replacing ln(1 es) in (12) by es, and this by while respecting (6a), one obtains , (17) where means the number of moles, and R the constant in the equation of state of the ideal gases. By rubbing with flannel we separate them. By ruthlessly pressing her claims she is hastening the economic and therewith the moral collapse of Europe; she has helped to Balkanize Europe, and therefore shares the responsibility for the breakdown of political morality and the growth of that spirit of revenge which feeds on despair.
By shrinking the circular magnetic lines of force to a point, the second half-step is per- formed and the whole step yields a connection between the changes of the magnetic and electric fields at an arbitrary point in spacfc and at an arbitrary instant. By subtraction we obtain from these equations H . By that, the general theory of relativity as a logical building is eventually finished. By the Lorentz transformation, we are allowed to effect certain changes of the time parameter. By the a.ddition of four tensore of this type, we obt&in the tensor A,,_y with a.ny ssigned componente. By the aid of language different individuals can, to a certain extent, compare their experiences.
By the consideration of a simple example they are led to modify slightly the gravitational equations which then admit regular solutions for the static spherically symmetric case. By the discussion of a sequence of experiments a new idea was born, that of a crowd with the individuals behaving in an unpredictable way. By the energy principle, we have E = e + L Now consider the object and the same emitted radiation from a reference frame moving with velocity relative to the object. By the introduction of the imaginary time variable, x4 = il , Minkowski has made the theory of invariants for the four-dimensional continuum of physical phenomena fully analogous to the theory of invariants for the three-dimensional continuum of Euclidean space.
By the mere ex- istence of his stomach everyone was condemned to par- ticipate in that chase. By the motion of a body we always mean its change of position in relation to a second body. By the principle of relativity this electric charge is also of the magnitude OoneO when measured in the moving system.
By the reduction of (38) with reference to the indices (3 and o- ( inner multiplication with 6 I , we get a con- travariant four-vector 17 130 PRINCIPLE OF itELATlVITY On the account of the symraetrv of -^ witli ( " ) reference to the indices (3, and k, the third member of the right hand side vanishes when A '^ is an antisymmetrical tensor, which we assume here ; the second member can be transformed according to (29a) ; we therefore get (40) ^/^-g dx^ This is the expression of the direro'ence of a contra - variant six-vector.

By the same token we wish to draw the attenti.on of intellectual workers to the great danger that now menaces these liberti.es.
By the simplest system we do not mean the one which the student will have the least trouble in assimilating, but the one which con- tains the fewest possible mutually independent postu- lates or axioms; since the content of these logical, mutually independent axioms represents that re- mainder which is not comprehended.
By the special prin- nple of relativity is meant the generalization of this definition to include any natural event whatever: thus, every universal law of nature which is valid in relation to a co-ordinate system C, must also be valid, as it stands, in relation to a co-ordinate system C, which is in uniform translatory motion relatively to C. The second principle, on which the special theory of relativity rests, is the ^principle of the constant velocity of light in vacuo/^ This principle asserts that light in vacuo always has a definite velocity of propa- gation (independent of the state of motion of the observer or of the source of the light).
By the special theory of relativity the expression ds2 = - dX2 - d X" - dX" + d X" (1) tben has a value which is independent of the orientation of the loca! By the special theory of relativity the velocity of light is given by the equation - dx - dx - dx: + dx: = O and therefore by the genera.I theory of relativity by the equation . By the time it was realized that this programme could not be carried out, the achievements of the field theory had already become too striking and important for it to be exchanged for a mechanical dogma.
By the time this point was reached, nobody any longer believed in immediate momentary action at a distance, not even in the sphere of gravitation, even though no field theory of the latter had been clearly sketched out owing to lack of sufficient factual knowledge. By the turn of the century the conception of the electro- magnetic field as an ultimate entity had been gen- erally accepted and serious thinkers had abandoned the belief in the justification, or the possibility, of a mechanical explanation of Clerk Maxwell's equa- tions. By the use of a clock the time concept becomes objective.
By the word special, it is sij^nilied that the principle is limited to the ease, when K' has nniform trandatory motion with reference to K., but the equivalence of K and K' does not extend to the ease of no n -uniform motion of K' relative to K. The Special Relativity Theory does not differ from the classical mechanics through the assumption of this postu- late, but only through the postulate of the constancy of light-velocity in vacuum which, when combined with the special relativity postulate, gives in a well-known way, the relativity of synchronism as well as the Lorenz-transfor- mation, with all the relations between moving rigid bodies and clocks. By this conception of time and space, the (", y, z) mani- foldness t = o and its two sides /<o and t>o falls asunder.
By this formulation one reduces the whole mechanics of gravitation to the solution of a single system of covariant par? By this it was implied that the carrier of the field could have velocity, and this was naturally to apply to the "vacuum" (ether) also. By this last we mean the effort to reduce all concepts and correlations to as few as possible logically independent basic concepts and axioms. By this means all problems in the optics of moving bodies will be reduced to a series of problems in the optics of stationary bodies. By this means it could also be ascertained in what manner the line sun-earth revolves round the sun. By this means we are able for the first time to formulate generally covariant differential equations.
By this method one can readily obtain a solution which, except for two point singularities lying on the axis of symmetry, is everywhere regular and. By this procedure time lost its absolute character, an was included with the "spacial" coordinates as of algebra1clly ( nearly ) similar character. By this simplifica- tion, S vanishes of itself so that tensor B reduces to [XV I I shall give in the following pages all relations in the jriimplified form, with the above-named specialisation of the co-ordinates.
By this we mean that it is possible to describe the position of a point (at rest) by means of three numbers (co-ordinales) x, y, z, and that there is an indefinite number of points in the neighbourhood of this one, the position of which can be described by co-ordinates such as x1, y1, z1, which may be as near as we choose to the respective values of the co-ordinates x, y, z, of the first point. By thus holding the mirror up to us all you have had a liberating effect on us such as hardly any other of our contemporaries has done and have relieved life of something of its earth-bound heaviness. By using the electron theory, Lorentz in his above mentioned essay traces the Laws of Electro-d3mamics of Ponderable Bodies to still simpler laws.
By using the means of production, the worker produces new goods which become the property of the capitalist. By v we shall denote any vector which is perpendicular to v, and by i\, r^ we shall denote components o r in direction of^ and v. Instead of {x, y^ z, t), new magnetudes {x' ij z t') will be introduced in the following way. By very ingenious and intricate experiments we can find out how the particles resist the action of an external force. By way of the understanding he achieves a far-reaching eman? By way of the understanding he achieves a far-reaching emancipation from the shackles of persona! C A'*=A 1+^ From these equations, it appears that for an observer, which moves with the velocity c towards the source of light, the source should appear infinitely intense.
C. THE THEORY OF THE GRAVITATION-FIELD 13. CHILDREN: I rejoice to see you before me today, happy youth of a sunny and fortunate land. CLERK MAXWELLS INFLUENCE ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE IDEA OF PHYSICAL REALITY The belief in an external world independent of the perceiving subject is the basis of all natural science. COMBINED FIELD ELECTRICITY The simplest method of fitting electricity into the conceptual framework of the general theory of relativity is based on the following train of. CONCEPT OF TIME 19 A to P, and if ^= " < 1, then by a special Lorentz transformation, in which A P is taken as the axis_, and which has the moment^, we can introduce a time parameter t\ which (see equation 11, 12, 4) has got the same value t' = o for both space-time points (A, t^), and P, t).
CONCLI SIGN From the conceptual stand-point there are several important consequences of the Generalised or Gravitational Theory of Relativity. Calculation of I 5 It is much simpler to calculate the effect of the irregularity of the elementary processes on the mechanical behaviour of the molecule, because the calculation can be based on a molecule at rest, to the degree of approximation to which we had restricted ourselves from the Deginning. Calculation of R Consider a molecule of the kind discussed above, moving uniformly with velocity v along the X-axis of the coordinate system K. We wish to find the average momentum which is transferred from the radiation field to the molecule per unit time.
Can any observer, at rest relative to K', then conclude that he is in an actually accelerated reference-system ? Can anyone imagine Moses, Jesus, or Gandhi anned with the money-bags of Carnegie? Can anyone imagine Moses, Jesus, or Gandhi armed with the money-bags of Carnegie? Can goods be produced as economically under such a system as under one which leaves more freedom to individual enterprise? Can it possibly be wrong to say that a carriage drawn by four horses must travel faster than one drawn by only two? Can religion be superseded by science? Can this system maintain itself at al!without the terror that has so far accompanied it, to which none of us westerners would care to expose himself?
Can this system maintain itself at all without the terror that has so far accompanied it, which none of us "westerners" would care to let himself in for? Can we hope to be guided in the right way by experience w^hen there exist theories (such as classical mechanics) which to a large extent do justice to experience, without getting to the root of the matter? Can we liken the reader ofsuch a book to the scientists, who throughout successive generations continue to seek solutions of the mysteries in the book of nature? Can we make an equally simple assumption about the length of the force vectors? Can we not assume such changes in the rhythm of the moving clock and in the length of the moving rod that the constancy of the velocity of light will follow directly from these assumptions?
Can we not decide this by experiment? Can we not isolate one of them? Can we picture to ourselves a three-dimensional universe which is finite, yet unbounded? Can you imagine an organization of scientists making the discoveries of Charles Darwin? Can you imagine that any man truly :6.lled with this ideai could be content:- Were he to receive from his fellow men a much greater return in goods and services than most other men ever receive? Can you, as the Kellogg Pact does, condemn war and at the same time leave the individual to the tender mercies of the war machine in each country?
Canonical distribution of states In quantum theory a molecule of a given kind can only exist in a discrete set of states Z\, Zz, ... Zn, ..., with (internal) energies e 1; s2, ... en, ..., apart from its orientation and translatory motion. Carefully performed, this experiment reveals discrepancies between theory and experiment due to the rotation of the earth or, in other words, to the fact that the laws of mechanics, as here formulated, are not strictly valid in a co-ordinate sys- tem rigidly connected with the earth. Carrying out the calcula.tion, this gives B = 2a = "M A 2'1TA. Causal effect of any physical type can never travel with a velocity greater than that of light. Ceaseless work, supported by a noble purpose, is leading slowly but surely to success.
Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen have been seen to call for vatohtuin and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the AGwinistration. Certain considerations suggest that we should refer the same Galileian domains to nonGalileian reference-bodies also. Certain details can, however, also be deduced without difficulty from these facts. Certain direct electromagnetic experiments invohing relative motion of polarised dielectrics were no less conclu- sive against the generalised theory of Hertz and Heaviside. Certain it is that a convic- tion, akin to religious feeling, of the rationality or intelligibility of the world lies behind all scientific work of a higher order. Certain proceedings and pronouncements of the English administration have been justly criticized.
Certainly the possibility can be envisaged of building a bomb of far greater size, capable of producing destruction over a larger area. Certainly the same result could be found if the clock moved relative to an observer at rest in the upper c.s. Certainly, and one must take what Nature gives as one finds it. Certainly, and one must take what nature gives as one finds it. Certainly, from the standpoint of the special theory of relativity, the ether hypothesis appears at first to be an empty hypothesis. Changes of view are continually forced upon us by our attempts to understand reality. Characteristic of the theory we are presenting is the description of space by means of two sheets.
Christianity and Judaism If one purges the Judaism of the Prophets and Christianity as Jesus Christ taught it of all subsequent additions, especially those of the priests, one is left with a teaching which is capable of curing all the social ills of humanity. Classical and quantum physics differ radically. Classical mechanics and common sense disagree violently on this point. Classical mechanics required to be modified before it could come into line with the demands of the special theory of relativity. Classical mechanics, too, is based on the four-dimensional con- tinuum of space and time. Classical physics aims at a description of objects existing in space, and the formulation of laws governing their changes in time. Classical physics knows only an "absolute" time flow for all observers.
Clearly the rotation of space round the null-point belongs to this group of transformations. Clearly this cuts the unlimited world-line of the electron at a single point P, because these directions are all time-like vectors. Clearly to recognize this axiom and its arbitrary character really implies already the solution of the problem. Clearly, in such a process, only a vanishingly small part of those energy distributions, which must be possible according the fundamental principles of the theory, are drawn upon to determine the entropy. Clearly, the following are invariants for such a vector when subjected to a group of Lorentz transformation. Clearly, the oscillatory structure of radiation does indeed give rise to variations in the radiation pressure, as predicted.
Clerk Maxwell, Boltzmann, and Lord Kelvin never wearied of tracing the electromagnetic fields and their reciprocal dynamic actions back to the mechanical action of hypothetical continuously diffused masses. ClichZs of yesterday will no longer do today, and will, no doubt, be hopelessly out of date to? Clocks, for which the law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the definition of time. Co-operation and the division of labour are carried through more easily and with less friction than in Europe, whether in the factory or the university or in private good works. Co-variant Differentiation of Tensors. Coal represents chemical energy, liberated as heat when the coal burns. Collisions with gas molecules at irregular intervals give the plate irregular momentum.

Comparing (9) with (10), we see that there is no difference between tbe new field equations and tbe earlier ones, except that instead of T"'" as tensor of " gravitating mass " there now occurs T11 + " g11 (G - G0 ) which is independent of the scalar of curvature. Comparing the predictions of our two observers, we find a most astonishing result which flatly contradicts the apparently well-founded concepts of classical physics. Comparing the two methods of approaching the problem, we can say: the intuitive idea is the greater the action, the greater the velocity. Comparison with (41b) shows that with the choice of system of co-ordinates which we have made, this equation predicates nothing more or less than the vanishing of di?
Comparison with the discussion in Section 11 shows that also from the standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty was the right one. Compulsory Service From a letter Instead of permission being given to Germany to introduce compulsory service it ought to be taken away from everybody else: in future none but mercenary armies should be permitted, the size and equipment of which should be discussed at Geneva. Compulsory arbitration must be supported by an executive force, guaranteed by all the participating countries, which is ready to proceed against the disturber of the peace with economic and military sanctions.
Compulsory military service seems to me the most disgraceful symptom of that deficiency in personal dignity from which civilized mankind is suffering to-day. Compulsory service, as the bulwark of unhealthy nationalism, must be combated; most important of all, conscientious objectors must be protected on an international basis. Concepts can only acquire content when they are connected, however indirectly, with sensible experience. Concerning PlanckOs Determination of the Fundamental Constants We wish to show in the following that Herr PlanckOs determination of the fundamental constants is, to a certain extent, independent of his theory of blackbody radiation.
Concerning StokesOs Rule According to the result just obtained, let us assume that, when monochromatic light is transformed through photoluminescence into light of a different 11 frequency, both the incident and emitted light consist of energy quanta of magnitude R? Concerning a Difficulty with Regard to the Theory of Blackbody Radiation We start first with the point of view taken in the Maxwellian and the electron theories and consider the following case.
Concerning such I would like to state a theorem which at present can- not be based upon anything more than upon a faith in the simplicity, i.e., intelligibility, of nature: there are no arbitrary constants of this kind; that is to say, nature is so con- stituted that it is possible logically to lay down such strongly determined laws that within these laws only ra- tionally completely determined con- stants occur (not constants, therefore, whose numerical value could be changed without destroying the theory).
Concerning the Emission of Cathode Rays Through Illumination of Solid Bodies The usual conception that the energy of light is continuously distributed over the space through which it propagates, encounters very serious difficulties when one attempts to explain the photoelectric phenomena, as has been pointed out in Herr LenardOs pioneering paper.4 According to the concept that the incident light consists of energy quanta of magnitude R? Concerning the Entropy of Radiation The following treatment is to be found in a famous work by Herr W. Wien and is introduced here only for the sake of completeness.
Concerning the Ionization of Gases by Ultraviolet Light Solid Bodies We shall have to assume that, the ionization of a gas by ultraviolet light, an individual light energy quantum is used for the ionization of an individual gas molecule. Concerning the policies of the American Government since the end of the war, I am neither willing, nor able, nor entitled to justif y or explain them. Conclusion We now have to show that the momenta transferred from the radiation field to the molecule according to our basic hypotheses, never disturb the thermodynamic equilibrium. Conclusions obtained by purely rational processes are, so far as Reality is concerned, entirely empty. Condition for skew-symmetry: A?? Conditions such as exist in Argentina and Spain should be dealt with.
Congratulations to Dr. Solf I am delighted to be able to offer you, Dr. Solf, the heartiest congratulations, the congratulations of Lessing College, of which you have become an indispensable pillar, and the congratulations of all who are convinced of the need for close contact between science and art and the public which is hungry for spiritual nourishment. Congratulations to a Critic To see with one's own eyes, to feel and judge without succumbing to the suggestive power of the fashion of the day, to be able to express what one has seen and felt in a snappy sentence or even in a cunningly wrought word is that not glorious? Congresses were and still are held from which colleagues from ex-enemy countries are excluded.
Conscious man, to be sure, has at all times been keenly wrested from death. Consequently I saw myself in the position of Buridan's ass, which was unable to decide upon any specific bundle of hay. Consequently it may be formulated as follows: If two ideal clocks are going at the same rate at any, time and at any place (being then in immediate proximity to each other), they will always go at the same rate, no matter where and when they are again compared with each other at one place.
Consequently it may be formulated as follows:If two ideal clocks are going at the same rate at any time and at any place (being then in immediate proximity to each other), they will always go at the same rate, no matter where and when they are again compared with each other at one place.If this law were not valid for real clocks, the proper frequencies for the separate atoms of the same chemical element would not be in such exact agreement as experience demonstrates. Consequently no compensation due to Fresnelian convection Xll ^PRINCIPLE OP RELATIVITY of ether by moving medium is possible. Consequently the " - g right-hand side also vanishes. Consequently the electric feld appeared decomposed into the electric feld strength and the dielectric displacement.
Consequently the first three equations above allow themselves to be clothed in words in the two following ways:N 1. Consequently there cannot be a church whose chief doc trines are based on the cosmic religious experience. Consequently, the laws for transforming these quantities from one to another allowable (inertial) system of co-ordinates are uniquely determined. Consequently, the obituary can limit itself in the main to the communicating of thoughts which have played a considerable role in my endeavors. Consider a body at rest, where there is no motion at all. Consider a material point resting on the upper rod. Consider a mechanical system constituted of two partial systems A and B which have interaction with each other only during limited time.
Consider an arbitrary event, causing a momentum transfer A to a molecule in the -X'-direction. Consider another experimental arrangement. Consider from this standpoint the position of the Press, or of the schools with their competitive methodl Everything is dominated by the cult of efficiency and of success and not by the value of things and men in relation to the moral ends of human so? Consider the case of a system of coordinates which is conceived as being in stable rotation relative to a system of inertia in the New? Consider the laws governing the production of secondary cathode radiation by X-rays.
Consider two material points of a solid body at rest ; then according' to these conceptions their corres- ponds to these points a wholly definite extent of length, independent of kind, position, orientation and time of the body. Consider waves on the surface of water. Consider, for example, a pendulum whose mass swings back and forth between the points A and B. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. Considerations on the Universe as a Whole.
Considered formally, the admission of a coordinate system which is accelerated with respect to the originai "inertial" coordinates means the admission of non-linear coordinate transfonnations, hence a mighty enlargement of the idea of invariance, i.e., the principle of relativity. Considered from this standpoint, we must regard x1, x2, x t3, as the four co-ordinates of an event in the fourdimensional continuum. Considered logically this con where the shoe pinches. Considered, then, from, the point of view of sense experience, the development of the concept of space seems, after these brief indications, to conform to the following schema solid body; spatial relations of solid bodies ; interval ; space.
Considering the whole process of motion in questions, the first of equations A) holds, we obtain : V V c^ For v=c, W is infinitely great. Contra-variant and co-imriant Four-vector. Contract (52) with respect to tbe indices , and u, and af ter multiplying tbe resulting equation by to", subtract it from equation (52). Contracting (39) with respect to the indices a and u, and taking (29a) into consideration, we obtain - gA,. Contracting (43) with respect to the indices T and p we obtain the covariant tensor of second rank The mathematicians have proved that this is also a sufficient condition,where G,... = B.p = R,... + S,... RI'. Contracting the tensor on the left and taking the time average we obtain the virial theorem, which we shall not consider further.

Contravariant tensor :If we now calculate all the 16 products A^ of the components A'^ B^ , of two eon- travariant four- vectors a'**', will according to (8) and (5 a) satisfy the following transformation law. Conventional words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage, when the mentioned associative play is sufficiently established and can be reproduced at will. Conversely, an observation of the final tem- perature, together with a little algebra, would enable us to find the ratio of the two specific heats. Conversely, if A does not know the velocity of light but assumes that his companion kept the agree- ment, and he notices the opening of 5's lantern two seconds after he opened his, he can conclude that the speed of light is one mile per second.
Conversely, the continuation of military preparations on the present scale will inevitably lead to new catastrophes. Conversely, the tensor character of (A) may be inferred, if it is known that the expression (8) leads to an invariant for an arbitrary choice of the vectors (B), (C), etc. Conversely: a definite point in our time-space plane corresponds to every pair of numbers characterizing an event. Cooperation and the division of labor a develop more easily and with less friction than in Enrope, whether in the factory or the university or in private cbarity.
Copernicus had opened the eyes of the most in- telligent to the fact that the best way to get a clear grasp of the apparent movements of the planets in the heavens was by regarding them as movements around the sun conceived as stationary. Correspondence with the Prussian Academy of Sciences The following correspondence is here published for the first time in its authentic and complete form. Corresponding to each physically observable quantity A there is an operator, which may be designated by the same letter. Corresponding to the same complex of empirical data, there may be several theories, which differ from one another to a considerable extent. Correspondingly let us deline in the four-dimensional ease the product (P/) of any four- vector P and the six- vector./*.
Correspondingly, let us assume that a molecule may go from state Zm to a state Zn and emit radiation energy smsn with frequency (i, without excitation from external causes. Cosmological Difficulties of Newton's Theory. Cou- lomb's law is still valid and is contained in Maxwell's equations from which it can be deduced as one of the many consequences. Could we build a real relativistic physics valid in all c.s. Could we modify them to be valid everywhere? Could we reject the concept of matter and build a pure field physics? Covariant Four-vectors.- We cali four quantities Av the components of a covariant four-vector, if for any arbitrary choice of the contravariant four-vector B' .ZAvB' = Invariant (6) The law of transformation of a covariant four-vector follows from this definition.
Covariant Tensors.-On the other hand, if we take the sixteen products Av of two covariant four-vectors A and B,., Av = ABv , (10) the law of transformation for these is . Covariant and contravariant tensors may be looked upon as special cases of mixed tensors. Culture and Prosperity If one would estimate the damage done by the great political catastrophe to the development of human civilization, one must remember that culture in its higher forms is a delicate plant which depends on a complicated set of conditions and is wont to flourish only in a few places at any given time.

Curiously enough, one finds that the mass m is not determined by the electrical charge e, but that e and m are independent constants of inte- gration. D. THE '' MATEEIAL " PHENOMENA.

Derivation of the Planck radiation law We now look for that particular radiation density Q, for which the exchange of energy between radiation and molecules in keeping with the probability laws (A), (B), and (B') does not disturb the molecular distribution of states given by eq. Descartes was the first to introduce this method. Desire for approvai and recognition is a bealthy motive; but the desire to be acknowledged as better, stronger or more intelligent tban a fellow being or fellow scbolar easily leads to an excessively egoistic psycbological adjustment, wbicb may become injurious for the individuai and for the community.

Development of the various branches of physics, in each of which the object is the theoretical understanding of more or less restricted fields of experience, and in each of which the laws and concepts remain as closely as possible related to ex? Dielectricity, con- ductivity, etc., are determined ex- clusively by the type of mechanical tie connecting the particles, of which the bodies consist. Different types of waves have already been consid- ered. Differentiating twice by the time, we get d xdt2 2'? Difficulties of this kind, sudden and unexpected ob- stacles in the triumphant development of a theory, arise frequently in science.
Dirac found in the 'spinor-field'quantities of a new kind, whose simplestequationsmake it possibleto deducea great many of the propertiesof the electron, including its quantum properties. Dirac found in the spinors field-magni- tudes of a new sort, whose simplest equations enable one to a large extent to deduce the properties of the electron. Direct measure- ments splendidly confirm these predictions, and thus also the wave theory of light. Disarmament and security are only to be had in combination. Discontinuity replaced con- tinuity.

Do not gird at fate, but rather look on these events as a reason for remaining true to the cause of the Jewish commonwealth. Do the Galilean relativity principle and the classical transformation apply to optical and electrical phenomena as well as to mechanical? Do they stem from experiences of men and are they conditioned indirectly by such experiences? Do you not think that this is real progress? Do you suppose that any Japanese Government would be found ready to take the responsibility of plunging its country into such a perilous adventure? Does a piece of iron weigh more when red-hot than when ice-cold?
Does not such a rigid, centralized economie sys? Does not such a rigid, centralized system tend towards protection and hostility to advantageous innovations? Does the positive fluid flow to the negative body, or the negative fluid to the positive body? Does the product of such a modest effort de- serve to be called by the proud name of a theory of the Universe? Does there truly exist an insuperable contradiction between religion and science? Does this heat correspond to the diminution in me- chanical energy, that is kinetic and potential energy? Does this new concept of velocity satisfy the require- ment formulated for all generalizations? Does this permit an observer at rest relatively to K' to infer that he is on a " really " accelerated system of reference ?
Doing this we immediately arrive at equations ct (1'21) and (2'21) for the special case considered there. Don't listen to his words, examine his achievements.

During the elementary process of radiative loss, the molecule suffers a recoil of magnitude hvjc in a direction which is only determined by 'chance', according to the present state of the theory.

EDUCATION AND WORLD PEACE A message to the Progressive Ed ucation Association, No? EDUCATION FOR INDEPENDENT THOUGHT From the New York 'Times, October 5,1952. EMERGENCY COMMITTEE OF ATOMIC SCIENTISTS. ENSUIUNG THE FUTURE OF MANKIND M essage for Canadian Ed ucation Week, M arch 2-8, 1952. ETHER AND THE MECHANICAL VIEW The discussion of all the various attempts to understand the mechanical nature of the ether as a medium for transmitting light would make a long story. ETHER AND THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY. Each can be constructed from the other. Each group to be composed as follows: A doctor, elected by the Medical Association; A lawyer, elected by the lawyers; A working men's representative, elected by the trade unions; An ecclesiastic, elected by the ecclesiastics.
Each incident energy quantum of frequency ?1 is absorbed and generates by itselfat least at sufficiently low densities of incident energy quanta a light quantum of frequency ?2; it is possible that the absorption of the incident light quanta can give rise to the simultaneous emission of light quanta of frequencies ?3,?4 etc., as well as to energy of other kinds, e.g., heat. Each nation would undertake to abide by the orders issued by this legislative body, to invoke its decision in every dispute, to accept its judgments unreservedly and to carry out every measure the tribunal deems necessary for the execution of its decrees. Each of the colours will therefore be refracted along a different path and be separated from the others when the light leaves the prism.
Each of the complexes has the energy increase e - Since energy according to the usual definition E and hence, by a well known conclusion of Maxwell's theory, 2 it has the momentum K. Rigorously speaking this is the mo- 2c mentum of S with respect to Ko. Each of the observers determines the position on his own reference-body occupied by the stone at each tick of the clock he is holding in his hand. Each of them will help us to determine the time of the events happening in its immediate vicinity. Each of us has to do his little bit toward transforming this spirit of the times. Each of us has to do his little bit towards transforming this spirit of the times. Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he feels it.
Each one of these denotes a certain group of transformations for the differential equations of mechanics. Each one of us can do his part by working to bring about responsible public action based on understanding of the present crisis. Each one of us would be at fault if the goal were not reached in time. Each would like to translate the other's observations into his own language. Early in 1905, Einstein published "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions," scribing the physical world, yet also idealistic, in aiming for the minimum number of con cepts to achieve that description. Eco nomic production should make life possible, beautiful, and noble. Economie interlinking has made the destinies of nations interdependent to a degree far greater than in previous years.
Education and Educators A letter. Education for war, however, is a delusion. EemarJcs on the character of the spacC'time conthnmrn Our assumption that in an infinitely small region the special relativity theory holds, leads us to conelude that ds^ can always, according to (1) be exprersed in real magni- tudes r/X,..Y/X . Ees or the formation of cartels. Efforts were not lacking to ex? Egoism and competition are, alas, stronger forces than public spirit and sense of duty. Einstein has proposed a third crucial test. Einstein in his second theory extends the Relativity Principle to cases of accelerated motion. Einstein is a Swiss-German of Jewish extraction, and began his scientific career as a privat-dozent in the Swiss University of ZUrich about the year 1902.
Einstein is now only 45, and it is to be hoped that science will continue to be enriched, for a long time to come, with farther achievements of his genius. Einstein thought that a gravitational displacement of the Fraunhofer lines is a necessary and fundamental condition for the acceptance of his theorv. Einstein's Relativity is thus merely the consistent logical application of the well known physical principle that we can know nothing but relative motion. Einstein's studies on Relativity were commenced in the year 1905, and has been continued up to the present time. Einstein's theory connects up the law of gravitation with the laws of motion, and serves to establish a very intimate relationship between matter and physical space- time.
Einsteinian universe will then reduce to a finite system without boundaries, like the surface of a sphere. Either by trying to look upon contact forces as being themselves distant forces which admittedly are observable only at a very small distanceand this was the road which Newtons followers, who were entirely under the spell of his doctrine, mostly preferred to take; or by assuming that the Newtonian action at a distance is only apparently immediate action at a distance, but in truth is conveyed by a medium permeating space, whether by movements or by elastic deformation of this medium. Either course would be like a man with capital, and wishing another man to work with him on some enterprise, starting out by simply giving that man half of his money.
Either we may observe how the undulatory surface forming the boundary between water and air alters in the course of time; or elsewith the help of small floats, for instancewe can observe how the position of the separate particles of water alters in the course of time. Electric or magnetic *'field intensities" and "displacements" were treated as equally elementary variables, empty space as a special instance of a dielectric body. Electric waves behaved generally like light waves of very large wave length. Electron and photon seem to pass through the two holes. Electrons were the first elemen- tary particles of matter to be discovered. Electrostatic, magnetostatic and gravitational fields are all of different character.
Electrostatics is contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case ; the laws of the latter lead directly to those of the former for the case in which the fields are invariable with regard to time. Eliminating g4 from (9), we obtain for the linear element of the spherical space tbe expression d<T 2 = 'Yl'dl'a. Embedded in the tradition of the Jewish people there is a love of justice and reason which must continue to work for the good of all nations now and in the future. Eminent members of our race are already at work with all their might on the realization of this aim. Energy Tensor of the Electromagnetic Field. Energy and mass seem to be just as equivalent as heat and mechanical energy. Energy has mass and mass represents energy.
Energy quanta penetrate into the surface layer of the body, and their energy is transformed, at least in part, into kinetic energy of electrons. Energy radiates from the oscillating charge travelling with a definite speed through space; but a transference of energy, the motion of a state, is characteristic of all wave phenomena. Energy, at any rate kinetic energy, resists motion in the same way as ponderable masses. Enough for me the mystery of the eternity of life, and the inkling of the marvellous structure of reality, together with the single-hearted endeavour to comprehend a portion, be it never so tiny, of the reason that manifests itself in nature.
Enthusiasts, men of brilliant gifts, have cleared the way, and many excellent members of our race are prepared to devote themselves heart and soul to the cause. Envisaged in this way, axiomatic geometry and the part of natural law which has been given a conventional status appear as epistemologically equivalent. Equal quantities of heat Equal amounts of electric produce different changes of charge produce differem temperature in two bodies changes of electric potentia if their heat capacities are in two bodies if their elec different. Equation (21) expresses the conservation of momentum and energy.
Equation (4a) can be interpreted in a graphic manner by the statement : The scalar of curvature plays the part of a negative pressure which, outs1de of the electric corpuscles, has a constant value G0 In the in? Equation (66), if "O' vanishes, is, on account of (30), equivalent to (57) or (57a) respectively. Equation (I) can be used to find the coefficient of diffusion of the suspended substance.

Ero- sion will inevitably be comparatively extensive not merely on the right-hand wall but also on the right half of the bottom, so that there will be a tendency to assume the shape illustrated in fig. Erwin Schrodinger showed how this influence was to be taken into account, re-interpreting by an ingenious method certain formulations of classica!mechanics.
Especially in research thought, do the mental pictures or internal words present themselves in the full consciousness or in the fringeaconsciousness . Especially should young people be brought to a clear understanding of how great a responsibility American politicians assumed in fail? Ether and the mechanical view THE TWO ELECTRIC FLUIDS THE following pages contain a dull report of some very simple experiments. Ether must be assumed to exist everywhere, if we wish to explain optical phenomena mechanically. Ethical axioms are found and tested not very differently from the axioms of science. Euclid-Newtonian continuum is merely an abstraction, while physical space- time is the actual framework which has some definite HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION XXI curvature due to the presence of matter.
Euclid-Newtonian space-time is itot the actual space-time of Physics, simply because the former completely neglects the actual presence of matter. Euclidean Geometry therefore does not hold for the system K' ; the above Hxed concep- tions of co-ordinates which assume the validity of Euclidean Greometry fail with regard to the system K'. Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Continuum. Euclids mathematics, however, knew nothing of this concept as such ; they confined themselves to the concepts of the object, and the spatial relations between objects. Euler had already created the foundation of hydrodynamics.
Euler's Equations for a Frictionless Adiabatlc Fluid Let p and p be two scalars, the former of which we call the " pressure," the latter the " density " of a fluid ; and let an equation subsist bet. Euler's equations for fhctionless adiabatic liquid. Europe is half-way between the two. Europe is halfway between the two. European-American culture, and in particular of its brilliant flowering in the Italian Renaissance, which put an end to the stagnation of medieval Europe, has been the liberation and com? Even Maxwell and H. Hertz, who in retrospect appear as those who demolished the faith in mechanics as the final basis of all physical thinking, in their conscious thinking ad- hered throughout to mechanics as the secured basis of physics.
Even a mathematical formula would be complicated and awkward. Even among these there are prejudices of which I as a Jew am clearly conscious; but they are unimportant in comparison with the attitude of the "Whites" toward their fellow-citizens of darker complexion, particularly toward Negroes. Even an understanding of the laws of radioactive decomposition, at least in their broad lines, was provided by the theory. Even assuming that Russia is now opposed to the idea of world government, once she becomes convinced that world government is nonetheless in the making her whole attitude may change. Even at that time the question. Even before the war was over, and stili more after its end, Lorentz devoted himself to the work of international reconciliation.
Even before the war was over, and still more after its end, Lorentz devoted himself to the work of reconciliation. Even if a young person is lucky enough to obtain a scholarship for a short period he must endeavor to arrive as quickly as possible at definite conclusions. Even if heat is not used for raising the temperature of a body but for melting ice, say, or changing water into steam, we can still think of it as a substance and regain it entirely by freezing the water or liquefying the steam. Even if no additional observation could be quoted in favour of the new theory, if its explanation were just as good as the old one, we would still have to decide in favour of the new one because its assumptions are, from the viewpoint of fundamental principles, much simpler.
Even if only a small part of mankind strives for such goals, their superiority will prove itself in the long run. Even if only a smaller part of mankind strives for such goals, their superiority will prove itself in the long run. Even if there were more woman scientists of like caliber they would serve as no argument against the fundamental weakness of the feminine organization. Even if these efforts did not meet with complete success, still the fundamental concepts of mechanics had ceased to be looked upon as fundamental constituents of the phys- ical cosmos.
Even if this "Privy Council" has no definite powers it may nevertheless bring about the gradual composition of differences, and secure as united representation of the common interests of the country before the mandatory power, clear of the dust of ephemeral politics. Even if this were possible, it would take more than a human lifetime to set down the result on paper, owing to the enormous number of particles which would have to be considered. Even if we succeeded in this, a further step would still be necessary: the step from the inertial c.s. Even if we want to avoid too special assumptions we can still say one thing: the force between any two given particles depends only on the distance between them, like gravitational forces.
Even if you fully admitted that the protest was amply warranted by the facts, you would still, I expect, regard the behaviour of your fellow-citizen as an act of treachery. Even in Spinoza and as late as in Hegel this prejudice was the vitalizing force which seems stil! Even in Spinoza and as late as in Hegel this prejudice was the vitalizing force which seems still to have played the major role. Even in the relativity theory we can still use the dynamic picture if we prefer it. Even more than the will for power, the fear of sudden attack will prove to be disastrous for us if we do not openly and decisively meet the problem of depriving national spheres of power of their military strength, turning such power over to a supra? Even so, the nationalism can be progressively im?
Even so, the task confronting us requires of all con? Even standards of virtue, aspiration, and practical truth were taken for granted as an inviolable heritage, common to all civilized humanity. Even the Greeks bad already conceived tbe atomistic nature of matter and tbe concept was raised to a bigb degree of proba? Even the great Newton could not free himself from this error ( "Hypotheses non fingo"). Even the great difference in wealth, the superior power of a few, cannot undermine this healthy self-conf? Even the possi- bility of a spatio-temporal construction, which can be unambiguously coordinated with physical events, is denied.
Even the revolution in electro- dynamics and optics brought about by Faraday and Clerk Maxwell, which formed the first great funda- mental advance in theoretical physics since Newton, took place entirely under the segis of Newtons ideas. Even the wave theory of light made use of Newtons law of motion, after it had been applied to the mass of a continuum. Even then the discovery did not come automatically ; chance and experience had to intervene several times first. Even these latter are, to a far greater degree than is commonly credited, dependent on the stature of character. Even this simple idea, so clear to everyone, was not left untouched by the advance of science.
Even though by no means all gravitationial fields can be produced in this way, yet we may entertain the hope that the general law of gravitation will be derivable from such gravitational fields of a special kind. Even though classical mechanics does not supply us with a sufficiently broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical phenomena, still we must grant it a considerable measure of " truth," since it supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies with a delicacy of detail little short of wonderful. Even though it is being accelerated with respect to the "Galileian space" first considered, we can nevertheless regard the chest as being at rest.
Even though the investigation of the influence of the gravitational field of the sun on light rays is a purely objective matter, I cannot forbear to express my personal thanks to my English colleagues for their work; for without it I could hardly have lived to see the most important implica- tion of my theory tested. Even when I was a fairly precocious young man the nothingness of the hopes and strivings which chase most men restlessly through life came to my conscious- ness with considerable vitality. Even when the external and scientific requirements for the birth of an idea have long been there, it generally needs an external stimulus to make it actually happen; man has, so to speak, to stumble right up against the thing before the idea comes.
Even where there is no bend in the river, a circular movement of the kind shown in fig. Even with a pulverized fragment of a sphinx he observed the same phenomenon ! Even without delving deeply into theory, one notices that our theory of light cannot explain certain fundamental properties of phenomena associated with light. Eventually they will, we know, reach the same temperature. Every attempt to explain the electromagnetic phenomena in moving c.s. Every car driver can safely apply classical physics even if he increases his speed a hundred thousand times. Every change of an electric field produces a magnetic field; every change of this magnetic field produces an electric field; every change of..., and so on.
Every child at school knows, or believes he knows, that this propagation takes place in straight lines with a velocity c= 300,000 km./sec. Every citizen must make up his mind. Every co-ordinate system is equally suited for the description of events in nature. Every current is associated with a magnetic field, i.e., a force always acts on a magnetic pole brought near the wire through which a current flows. Every development re- veals, in the long run, new and deeper difficulties. Every experiment has given the same negative result as the Michelson-Morley one, and never revealed any dependence upon the direction of the motion of the earth. Every field theory, in our opinion, must therefore adhere to the fundamental principle that singularities of the field are to be excluded.
Every important advance brings new questions. Every intellectual who is called befare one of the committees ought to refuse to testify, i.e., he must be prepared far jail and economie ruin, in short, far the sacrifice of his personal welfare in the interest of the cultural welfare of his country. Every known wave spreads with some definite velocity, and so should a wave of light. Every line corresponds to a transition from higher to lower energy level. Every nation and every human being reveal clearly their aims, powers and weaknesses, and also their passions. Every observer has his own rod which forms his c.s., but there is only one clock for them all, Time is something " absolute" which flows in the same way for all observers in all c.s.
Every point on the mollusc is treated as a space-point, and every material point which is at rest relatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc is considered as referencebody.

Every reminiscence is colored by today's being what it is, and therefore by a deceptive point of view. Every serious scientific worker is painfully conscious of this involuntary rele? Every serious scientific worker is painfully conscious of this involuntary relegation to an ever-narrowing sphere of knowledge, which is threatening to deprive the investigator of his broad horizon and degrade him to the level of a mechanic. Every speculation must be tested by experiment.
Every step motivated by that assumption contributes to the general fear and distrust and hastens the final catastrophe. Every stripe, if it is very narrow, corresponds to a definite colour or, in the language of the wave theory, to a definite wave- length. Every such solution is at the same time a solution of the field problem and of the motion problem. Every switchback has its highest point, that from which it starts. Every theory has its period of gradual development and triumph, after which it may experience a rapid decline. Every velocity of matter is <1, smaller than the velo- city of propo^ation of light. Every wave must have a material medium in which it travels. Every wave-length be- tween the two ends of the visible spectrum is repre- sented.

Everybody acts not only under external compulsion but also in accordance with inner necessity.
Everybody felt his superiority, but nobody felt oppressed by it. Everyone fallowed him gladly, far they felt that he never set out to dominate but only to serve. Everyone followed him gladly, for they felt that he never set out to dominate but always simply to be of use. Everyone knows the correct answer. Everyone sits in the prison of his own ideas; he must burst it open, and that in his youth, and so try to test his ideas on reality. Everything depends on the degree to which words and word-combinations corre? Everything depends on the degree to which words and wordcombinations correspond to the world of impression. Everything is designed to save human Jabor. Everything is designed to save human labour.
Everything must be done to strengthen that confidence and anything avoided that might harm it. Everything must be done to strengthen that confidence and everything avoided that might harm it. Everything that men do or think concerns the satisfaction of the needs they feel or the escape from pain. Everything that the human race has done and thought is concerned with the satisfaction of deeply felt needs and the assuagement of pain. Everything which can be converted into either of them is also a form of energy. Everything would be either yellow or black! Everywhere Newton's actions-at-a-distance gave way to :fields spreading with finite velocity. Everywhere people are working with burning enthusiasm in the most difficult circumstances.
Evidence is conflicting and nothing conclusive can yet be asserted. Evidently it must be assumed that each single particle executes a movement which is indepen- dent of the movement of all other particles ; the movements of one and the same particle after MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES ~3 different intervals of time must be considered as mutually independent processes, so long as we think of these intervals of time as being chosen not too small.
Evidently the two systems of equations found for system k must express exactly the same thing, since both systems of equations are equivalent to the Maxwell-Hertz equations for system K. Since, further, the equations of the two systems agree, with the exception of the symbols for the vectors, it follows that the functions occurring in the systems of equations at corresponding places must agree, with the exception of a factor ? Evidently they are exactly the same as the laws of disposition of the discs L on the spherical surface. Evolution is going on in the direction of increasing simplicity of the logica!basis. Ex- amples of heating by friction are, as a matter of fact, much too numerous and familiar to need recounting. Ex:pression for the Pielda components of Gravitation.
Exact Formulation of the General Principle of Relativity. Exactly the same thing is expressed in two different ways: by the "timetable" and by the points on the plane. Exaggerated respect for athletics, an excess of coarse impressions which the complications of life through the technical discoveries of recent years has brought with it, the increased severity of the struggle for existence due to the economic crisis, the brutalization of political life all these factors are hostile to the ripening of the character and the desire for real culture, and stamp our age as barbarous, materialistic, and superficial. Examination of the position of one suspended particle, say every thirty seconds, reveals the fantastic form of its path.
Example : k.= g A fXV We would point out specially the following combinations: A'^' = /" /^ A A g g Q ^ jxv ^fxa'^vp (complement to the, co-variant or eontravariant tensors) and, B = a q^'^ A ^ We can call B the reduced tensor related to A . Examples of a similar kind such as the uusueeessful attempt to substantiate the motiou of the earth relative to the " Light-medium " lead us to the supposition that not only in mechanics, but also in electrodynamics, no properties of observed facts correspond to a concept of absolute rest: but that for all coordinate svstems for which the mechanical equations hold, the equivalent electrodyna- mieal and optical equations hold also, as has already been shown for magnitudes of the first order.
Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the Olight medium,O suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest. Examples:From the co-variant tensor of the second rank A and the contravariant tensor of the first rank B we get by outer multiplication the mixed tensor o" or D = A B . Expanding (11) in powers of ?, while respecting (20), one obtains ns = const. Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, one therefore obtains A* = 2RMvh. Experience alone can finally decide which of the two possibilities is realised in nature. Experience and the Special Theory of Relativity.
Experience and theory have gradually led to the conviction that light in empty space always travels with the same velocity e independent of its color and the state of motion of the source of light (principle of the constancy of the velocity of light-in the following referred to as "'L-principle"). Experience can of course guide us in our choice of serviceable mathematical concepts; it cannot possibly be the source from which they are derived; experience of course remains the sole criterionof the serviceabilityof a mathematicalconstructionfor physics, but the truly creative principleresides in mathematics.
Experience has led to the conviction that, on the one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on the other hand the velocity of transmission of light in vacuo has to be considered equal to a constant c. By uniting these two postulates we obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates x, y, z and the time t of the events which constitute the processes of nature. Experience may suggest the appropriate mathematical concepts, but they most certainly cannot be deduced from it. Experience remains, of course, the sole criterion of the physical utility of a mathe- matical construction. Experiment again confirms the prediction. Experiment fully confirms our guess ! Experiment has confirmed the prediction of theory.
Experiment has shown that the velocity of sound in air is the same in all directions, if there is no wind and the air is at rest in the chosen c.s. Experiment proved that it is, in fact, possible to diffract the X-ray wave by means of these closely packed obstacles disposed in the regular three-dimensional arrangement occurring in a crystal. Experiment shows that it does not. Experiment1) decides in favour of equation (B) derived from the theory of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed, very exact. Experimental difficulties are very considerable here, as the shift of spectral lines is a complex phenomenon. Experiments on animals and a systematic investigation of the growth of tissues in a nutrient fluid were carried out side by side.
Experiments on interference made with particle rays have given a brilliant proof that the wave character of phenomena of motion as assumed by the theory does, really, correspond to the facts. Exploitation of foreign nations would then consist in the fact that the labor value of imports would considerably exceed that of exports. Expressed in an abstract manner we may say : If a mass m is moving uniformly in a straight line with respect to a co-ordinate system K, then it will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line relative to a second co-ordinate system K1 provided that the latter is executing a uniform translatory motion with respect to K. In accordance with the discussion contained in the preceding section, it follows that: If K is a Galileian co-ordinate system.
Expressed mathematically, Vabs = V + v where is always smaller than one. Expressing the same fact in the field language, we can say: an electrostatic field does not influence a magnetostatic one and vice versa. Expression for the field-components of gravitation. External compulsion can, to a certain extent, reduce but never cancel the responsibility of the individual. F rom the covariant tensor of the second rank Av and the contravariant tensor of the first rank B" we form by outer inultiplication the mixed tensor D:v = AvB 0 On contraction with respect to the indices 11 and a-, we obtain theacovariant fonr-vector D = D;v = AvB" .

Facts and theories not reached by this road had to be omitted. Failure to understand this fact constituted the basic philosophical error of so many investigators of the nineteenth century. Faithfully yours, Albert Einstein
Famous as a writer for his pungent criticism of State and Society and for his courageous program to alleviate social evils. Far I bave myself visited your beautiful country, seen its cities and houses, its mountains and woods, and the Japanese boys who had learned to love their country far its beauty. Far a successful man is he who receives a great deal from his fellow? Far ali these reasons I rejoice that through the energy and intelligence of the faunders, the university courses at Davos have already attained such a measure of success that the enterprise has outgrown the troubles of infancy. Far be it from me to argue with you about what inroads on human liberty may be justified by reasons of State.
Far example, a con:Hict arises when a religious community insists on the absolute truthfulness of all statements recorded in the Bible. Far farce always attracts men of low morality, and I believe it to be an invariable rule that tyrants of genius are succeeded by scoundrels. Far in how unfortunate a state must a community find itself if it cannot produce a more suitable candidate upon whom to confer such a distinction? Far it is not easy to take up the attitude of impartial observer when one is received with such kindness and undeserved respect as 3 4 IDEAS AND OPINIONS I bave been in America. Far it is true also of him tbat pleasure in the sbaping of his work is killed by farce and exterior pressure.
Far science can on!y ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of ts domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Far the scientific method can teach us nothing else beyond how facts are related to, and conditioned by, each other. Far these rules, or laws of nature, absolutely generai validity is required-not proven. Far this fear seems to me, for example, to be the cause for conceiving of the "thing" as a "bundle of qualities," such that the "qualities" are to be taken from the sensory raw material. Far this reason I am not at all anxious to talee sides in the struggle between the followers of the classical philologic-historical education and the education more devoted to natural science.
Far this reason I bave always been passionately opposed to systems sucb as we see in Italy and Rus? Far this there is just as little a universal remedy as there is far an individuai to remain well. Far war or wars will end in one power being supreme and dominating the rest of the world by its overwhelming military sb"ength. Far-sighted men with a clear understanding of the situation have set up institutions by which scientific work of every sort is to be kept going in Germany and Austria. Faraday conceived a new sort of real physical entity, namely the field, in addition to the mass-point and its motion.
Faraday must have grasped with unerring instinct the artificial nature of all attempts to refer electromagnetic phenomena to actions-at-a-distance between electric particles reacting on each other.

Fifty years ago, Hertz proved, for the first time, the existence of electromagnetic waves and confirmed ex- perimentally that their velocity is equal to that of light. Finally I would like to draw attention to a paradox which I have been unable to resolve. Finally he also discovered that the square of the period of circulation around the sun varies as the cube of the major axes of the ellipse.
Finally in this place I thank my friend Grossmann, by whose help I was not only spared the study of the mathematical literature pertinent to this subject, but who also aided me in the researches on the field equations of gravitation. Finally let us enquire about the laws which lead to the determination of the vector w as a function of {'(,i/,z,f.) Finally we reach his conclusion : And, in reasoning on this subject, we must not forget to consider that most remarkable circumstance, that the source of the Heat generated by friction, in these Experiments, appeared evidently to be inexhaustible.
Finally, I believe that an association formed of persons such as I have described, each highly esteemed in his own line, would be just the thing to give valuable moral support to those elements in the League of Nations which are really working for the great object for which that institution exists. Finally, I wish to emphasize once more that what has been said here in a somewhat categorica! Finally, I wish to emphasize once more that what has been said here in a somewhat categorical form does not claim to mean more than the personal opinion of a man, which is founded upon nothing but his own personal experience, which he has gathered as a student and as a teacher.
Finally, I would draw your attention to a book, War again To-morrow, by Ludwig Bauer, which discusses the issues here involved in an acute and unprejudiced manner and with great psychological insight. Finally, from what has been proved, we can deduce the following law which can be easily generalized for any kind of tensor : If the quanties A B form a tensor of the first rank, when B is any arbitrarily chosen four-vector, then A is a tensor of the second rank. Finally, if the position is given for every instant or, as the mathematicians say, if the space co-ordinate is given as a function of time, then our set of points becomes a continuous line.
Finally, it can also be expressed thus: Bodies in a gravitational feld behave as in the absence of a gravitational field if, in the latter case, the system of reference used is a uniformly accelerated coordinate system ( instead of an in? Finally, it is at least of indirect importance that in geography, as well as in history, a sympa? Finally, no real loss of generality is introduced if we perform the calculations as if the states with index m and n were the only possible states for the molecule. Finally, the general principle of relativity permits us to determine the influence of the gravitational field on the course of all those processes which take place according to known laws when a gravitational field is absent i.e.
Finally, the longer the cross section of the river, the more slowly will the circular movement be absorbed by friction ; the wave-line of the meander- formation will therefore increase with the cross sec- tion of the river. Finally, there follows from what has been proved, tbis law, which may also be generalized for any tensors : If for any choice of the four-vector B'' the quantities AvB" form a tensor of the frst rank, then Av is a tensor of the second rank. Finally, those statistica.I objections must be raised against this view which were mentioned in respect of the Newtonian theory. Finally, with Minkowski, we introduce in place of the real time co-ordinate l = ct , the imaginary time co-ordinate x4 = il = ict( ?
Finding that the velocity of the first mass is three times greater than that of the second, we conclude that the first mass is three times smaller than the second. First a remark concerning the relation of the theory to "four-di- mensional space." First he had to make a guess at the mathematical nature of the curve described by the orbit, and then try it out on a vast assemblage of figures. First of ali!et me say something on this score. First of all it is clear that the transformation law between (13) and (13') must be the same as that for the squares of the amplitudes, A 2 and A ' 2 , of a plane wave with corresponding direction. First of all let me say something on this head.
First of all we will indicate a method which does not in itself claim to be taken seriously ; it merely serves a.s a foil for what is to follow. First of all, an obervation of epistemological nature. First of all, an observation of epistemological nature. First of all, it is clear that the erosion must be stronger the greater the velocity of the current where it touches the bank in question, or the more steeply it fahs to zero at any particular point of the confining wall. First we get the law, and then we simplify its expression by a special choice of the system of reference. First we notice an arrow near the wire indicating the direction of the current, from higher to lower potential.
First we try to get clearly in our minds how far the system of classica!mechanics has shown itself adequate to serve as a basis for the whole of physics. First, a penetrating discussion, using the results of the spe? First, a remark concerning the theory as it is characterized above. First, teacbers should grow up in sucb scbools. First, the authority of the Genera} Assembly must be increased so that the Security Council as well as all other bodies of the UN will be subordinated to it. First, the construction of a simple mechanical picture of the ether proved to be impossible and was discarded. Firstly, with the support of equation (la).
Firstlythose equations, which,when v, the velocity of matter is given as a function of (r, i/, ~, t),lead us to a knowledge of other magnitude as functions of x, y, r, t I shall call this first class of equations the fundamental equations Secondly, the expressions for the ponderomotive force, which, by the application of the Laws of Mechanics, gives us further information about the vector u as functions of a-, y, ~, t). Five events are registered in our "timetable," each represented by two numbers, the time and space co-ordinates of each event. Flat beings with flat implements, and in particular flat rigid measuring-rods, are free to move in a plane. Footnotes 1) A simple derivation of the Lorentz transformation is given in Appendix I.

Footnotes 1) For the radius R of the universe we obtain the equation The use of the CGS system in this equation gives 2/k = 1.08.1027; p is the average density of the matter and k is a constant connected with the Newtonian constant of gravitation.
Footnotes 1) Proof N According to the theory of Newton, the number of "lines of force" which come from infinity and terminate in a mass m is proportional to the mass m. If, on the average, the Mass density p0 is constant throughout tithe universe, then a sphere of volume V will enclose the average man p0V. Footnotes 1) The field disappears at the centre of the disc and increases proportionally to the distancefrom the centre as we proceed outwards. Footnotes 1) The general theory of relativity renders it likely that the electrical masses of an electron are held together by gravitational forces. Footnotes 1) The objection is of importance more especially when the state of motion of the referencebody is of such a nature that it does not require any external agency for its maintenance, e.g.
Footnotes 1) We suppose further, that, when three events A, B and C occur in different places in such a manner that A is simultaneous with B and B is simultaneous with C (simultaneous in the sense of the above definition), then the criterion for the simultaneity of the pair of events A, C is also satisfied. For A as Lorentz transformation, we have further Det A= +1, the quantities involvinoj the index 4 once in the subscript are purely imaginary, the other co-efficients are real, and n^^'^0. For Clerk Maxwell him- self the ether was still an entity with purely mechani- cal properties, though of a far more complicated kind than those of tangible solid bodies. For I can only say that this bluish something will cause the emission of the steam, or at least possibly it may do so.
For I have myself visited your beautiful country, seen its cities and houses, its mountains and woods, and in them Japanese boys who had learnt from them to love their country. For Maxwell himself the ether indeed still had properties which were purely mechanical, although of a much more complicated kind than the mechanical properties of tangible solid bodies. For Newton's equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out in full, is (Inert mass) . For \f it were possible to regard the universe as a continuum which is finite ( closed ) with respect to 'its spatial dimensions , we should bave no need at all of any such boundary conditions.

For a given radiation A2 and R can be calculated, using our hypotheses on the interaction between radiation and molecules. For a mass increase to be measurable, the change of energy per mass unit must be enormously large. For a moment we shall not suppose any special relation to hold between the unit of length and the unit of time, so that instead of t, f, q, we shall write ct, cl', and q/c, where c represents a certain positive constant, and q is <c. For a plane surface, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, both lengths being measured with the same rod, is, according to Euclidean geometry of the plane, equal to a constant value !, which is independent of the diameter of the circle. For a ray of light emitted at the time ?
For a ray of light which passes the sun at a distance of _ sun-radii from its centre, the angle of deflection (a) should amount to It may be added that, according to the theory, half of this deflection is produced by the Newtonian field of attraction of the sun, and the other half by the geometrical modification (" curvature ") of space caused by the sun. For a singularity brings so much arbitrariness into the theory that it actually nullifies its laws. For a theoretical discussion, however, such small effects should be considered on a completely equal footing with more conspicuous effects of a radiative energy transfer, since energy and momentum are linked in the closest possible way.
For a theoretical explanation of this behavior it was necessary to assume that the energy of a mechanical system cannot assume any sort of value, but only certain discrete values whose mathematical expressions were always de? For a unit-measure of length laid " parallel " to the axis of a:, for example, we should have to set ds2 = - 1; dx = dx = dx4 = O. For a velocity larger than the velocity of light, our propositions become ON THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES 15 meaningless ; in our theory c plays the part of infinite velocity.
For a virtual displacement in the ^ichel we have postulated the condition that the points supposed to be substantial shall advance normally to the curves jxivins: their actual motion, which is \= o:, this condition denotes that the ^h is to satisfy the condition iL\ ^^-\-iL\ ^^-]rio^ ^^-^-w^ ^^=0, (15) Let us now turn our attention to the Maxwellian tensions in the electrodynamics of stationary bodies, and let us consider the results in 1'! For a wavelength of 0.5 m and a temperature T = 1700 K, this term is approximately 6.5 x 107 times larger than the second. For according to our 'way of looking at it, the same masses may appear to be either under the action of inertia alone (with respect to K) or under the combined action of inertia and gravitation (with respect to K').
For all of us who are concerned for peace and the triumph of reason and justice must today be keenly aware how small an influence reason and honest good will exert upon events in the politica!field. For all practical purposes, therefore, these loans must be considered gifts which may be used as weapons in the arena of power politics. For all these reasons he deserves our deepest reverence. For all thought acquires materia! For all thought acquires material content only through its relationship with that sensory material. For an absorption of energy, this takes place in the direction of propagation of the radiation bundle, for an emission in the opposite direction.
For an energy transfer by emission of radiation in the case of a Planck resonator, no momentum transfer to the resonator takes place, since emission occurs in the form of a spherical wave, according to classical theory. For an understanding over the supranational contrai of atomic energy has been made more remote. For any choice of the vectors d^ d^ this is scalar, and (TT g , according, to its defintion is a symmetrical thing in o- (TT and T, so it follows from the above results, that g is a contravariant tensor. For any one who is pervaded with the sense of causal law in all that happens. For as long as atomic energy and armaments are considered a vital part of national se? For at that time this was the only way one could conceive of states that were appar?
For besides B , there is no tensor of the second rank, which fX V can be built out of a ^s and their derivatives no his/her fjLV than the second, and which is also linear in them. For besides G1'" t.here is no tensor of second rank which is formed from the g.v and its derivatives, contains no derivations higher than second, and is linear in these derivatives. For brevity the summetion symbols here omitted in the formulre. For brevity, let us call this postulate the relativity principle. For by Jacobi's theorem, = dx' dx (65) dx' dx? For by appropriate partial integral tion we obtain . For by the method given above we prove the tensor character of (Av + Av), and from this the tensor character of Av follows on account of symmetry.
For c, we shall substitute the velocity of light c in free space. For completeness, however, I shall reproduce these simple arguments at this point. For different systems, the form of all physical laws is conserved. For distinguishing this system from another which will be introduced hereafter, we shall always call it " the stationary system," If a material point be at rest in this system, then its position in this system can be found out by a measuring rod, and can be expressed by the methods of Euclidean Geometry, or in Cartesian co-ordinates. For division among intellectuals has been partly to blame for the fact that the special parts and the experience which are the birthright of these groups ave so seldom been made available for politica!
For dynamics cannot manage with the concepts of the mass point and the (temporally A^ariable) distance between mass points alone. For earth-measuring has to do with the possibilities of the disposition of certain natural objects with respect to one another, namely, with parts of the earth, measuring-lines, measuring-wands, etc. For even if it should appear that the universe of ideas cannot be deduced from experience by logical means, but is, in a sense, a creation of the human mind, without which no science is possible, nevertheless this universe of ideas is just as little independent of the nature of our experiences as clothes are of the form of the human body.
For even when it is a question of describing the electrical elementary particles constituting matter, the attempt may still be made to ascribe physical importance to those ideas of fields which have been physically defined for the purpose of describing the geometrical behaviour of bodies which are large as compared with the molecule. For everything that is really great and in? For ex- ample, sodium, when incandescent, emits homogeneous yellow light. For example : CORPUSCULAR LANGUAGE WAVE LANGUAGE The corpuscles belonging The rays of different wave to different colours have the length belonging to differ- same velocity in vacuo, but ent colours have the same different velocities in glass. For example : we do not ask, "What is the speed of every particle at this moment?"
For example consider a massive particle resting on a circular disc. For example, I remember that an uncle told me the Pythagorean theorem before the holy geometry booklet had come into my hands. For example, a conflict arises when a religious co=unity insists on the absolute truthfulness of ali statements recorded in the Bble. For example, a ray of light proceeds from A at xl-time t towards B, arrives and is reflected from B at B-time t and returns to A at A-time t' . For example, a standing wave can have three nodes, one at each end and one in the centre. For example, corresponding to the above described figure, we can call // the time, but then necessarily the space connected with it must be expressed by the mani- foldness {/ y z).
For example, if /i = 100 km /sec, T = 8 days, ^|6' = 33 years (corresponding to an annual parallax of 'l'^)^ then T '2nAjc^=o. For example, if twenty lines are visible in the spectrum, each of them will be designated by one of twenty numbers expressing the corresponding wave- length. For example, if we take a rotation of the axes round the z-axis. For example, in order to include the atomistic character of electricity, the field equations only need to involve that a three-dimensional volume of space on whose boundary the electrical density vanishes everywhere, contains a total electrical charge of an integral amount. For example, it says !The laws of mechanics hold true for a space R^ relative to which the body S^ is at rest, not however for a space relative ta which S3 is at rest.
For example, most of the major states of history owed their existence to conquest. For example, the explanation of acoustical phenomena is based essentially on this concept. For example, the point P in the diagram has the Gaussian co-ordinates u= 3, v= 1. For example, this obviously holds in the case of the marble slab of the table and local variation of temperature. For example, we 108 ' PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITi' obtain the tensor T from the tensors A and B of different kinds ; T = A B , fxvcr /xv (T The proof of the tensor character of T, follows imme- diately from the expressions (8), (10) or (12), or the transformation equations (9), (11), (13); equations (8), (10) and (12) are themselves exaftiples of the outer multiplication of tensors of the first rank.
For example, we learn that a body which is in a state of uniform rectilinear motion with respect to K (in accordance with the law of Galilei) is executing an accelerated and in general curvilinear motion with respect to the accelerated reference-body K1 (chest). For example, when we wrote " a body moves uniformly. For example: 100 Ft. We then draw two perpendicular lines, calling the horizontal one, say, the time axis and the vertical one the space axis. For experiments upon the earth tell us nothing of the fact that we are moving about the sun with a velocity of approximately 30 kilometres a second. For feeling and longing are the motive forces of all human striving and productivity however nobly these latter may display themselves to us.
For fluorescence induced by cathode rays, which is the inverse process to the one discussed above, one obtains by analogous considerations: ?E + P0 3 R??. For force always attracts men of low morality, and I believe it to be an invariable rule that tyrants of genius are succeeded by scoundrels. For from (13) and (14) follows . For further discussion, a single element will serve just as well. For given time it has almost annihilated whole areas. For he did not place in the correct light the essentially constructive and speculative nature of thought and more especially of scientific thought; in consequence of which he condemned theory on precisely those points where its constructive-speculative character unconceala- bly comes to light, as, for example, in the kinetic atomic theory.
For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events. For him only substance and its changes were real. For him, an injustice done to the Jews is the same as an injustice done to himself. For how, otherwise, should it happen that sometimes we "wonder" quite spontaneously about some experi- ence? For how, otherwise, should the first observer know, i.e., be able to determine, that he is in a state of fast uniform mo- tion? For hydrogen gas under atmosheric pressure this quantity roughly equals 6 a 104, and thus is large compared to 1.
For if K be a system of co-ordinates relatively to which the Lorentzian ether is at rest, the MaxwellLorentz equations are valid primarily with reference to K. But by the special theory of relativity the same equations without any change of meaning also hold in relation to any new system of co-ordinates K' which is moving in uniform translation relatively to K. Now comes the anxious question:Why must I in the theory distinguish the K system above all K' systems, which are physically equivalent to it in all respects, by assuming that the ether is at rest relatively to the K system? For if a second system were given, of indefinitely small domains of the centres of gravity of the particles, and the latter designated dx:dyl'dzl' ; dx;dy,'dz[ .
For if both of them had simul- taneous reality and thus definite values these values would enter into the complete description, according to the condition of completeness. For if contradictions between theory and experience manifest themselves, we should rather decide to change physical laws than to change axiomatic Euclidean geometry. For if gravitational fields do play an essential part in the structure of the particles of matter, the transition to the limiting case of constant g. would, for them, lose its justification, for indeed, with constant g there could not be any particlcs of matter. For if no particular state of mo- tion belongs to the ether, there does not seem to be any ground for introducing it as an entity of a spe- cial sort alongside of space.
For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet an electric field with a certain definite energy, producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. For if there existed, among the majo;ity of citizens, the firm intention of establishing inter? For if they attempt to realise a straight line, they will obtain a curve, which we " three-dimensional beings " designate as a great circle, i.e. For if we consider a complete system (e.g.
For if we inquire into the deviations shown by the consequences of the general theory of relativity which are accessible to experience, when these are compared with the consequences of the Newtonian theory, we first of all find a deviation which shows itself in close proximity to gravitating mass, and has been confirmed in the case of the planet Mercury. For if we replace B' on the right-hand side of the equation .ZA'dB'" = l.'.AvB' by the expression resulting from the inversion of (5a), we obtain Since this equation is true for arbitrary values of the B'", it follows that the law of transformation is Levi-Civita, we denote the contravariant character by placing the index above, the covariant by placing it below.
For if we stick the paper discs on the globe, so that no disc overlaps another, the surface of the globe will finally become so full that there is no room for another disc. For in that case one could ascertain nothing empirically except how the direction of the straight sun-earth line changes in the course of the year (apparent move- ment of the sun with reference to the fixed stars). For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood fall in exactly the same manner in a gravitational field (in vacuo), when they start off from rest or with the same initial velocity. For instance, an ideal train or a ship sailing with delightful smoothness along a straight line and with a never-changing speed.
For instance, let us imagine somewhere in the surrounding space a screen so made that the particle sticks to it on coming into contact with it. For instance, to account for the atomic character of elec- tricity, the field equations need only lead to the following conclusions: A portion of space (three- dimensional) at whose boundaries electrical density disappears everywhere, always contains a total elec- trical charge whose size is represented by a whole number. For it cannot occasion surprise that different persons should arrive at the same logical conclusions when they have already agreed upon the fundamental laws (axioms), as well as the methods by which other laws are to be deduced therefrom.
For it follows from tbe assumption of a finite limit for <P at spatial infinity tbat a beavenly body with finite kinetic energy is able to reacb spatial infinity by overcoming the Newtonian forces of attraction. For it however, it is necessary to treat the fundamental equations from another point of view. For it is clear that, e.g., the gravitational field generated by a materia!
For it is composed of individual events, each of which is described by four numbers, namely, three space coordinates x, y, z, and a time co-ordinate, the time value t. The" world" is in this sense also a continuum; for to every event there are as many "neighbouring" events (realised or at least thinkable) as we care to choose, the co-ordinates x1, y1, z1, t1 of which differ by an indefinitely small amount from those of the event x, y, z, t originally considered. For it is not a difficult task to determine the physical state of a measuring-rod so accurately that its behaviour relatively to other measuring- bodies shall be sufficiently free from ambiguity to allow it to be substituted for the "rigid" body.
For it is not a difficult task to determine the physical state of a measuring-rod so accurately that its behaviour relatively to other measuring-bodies shall be sufficiently free from ambiguity to allow it to be substituted for the rigid body. For it is not easy to take up the attitude of an impartial observer when one is received with such kindness and undeserved respect as I have been in America. For it is true also of him tbat pleasure in the shaping of his work is killed by farce and exterior pressure.
For it to blossom there is needed, first of all, a certain degree of prosperity, which enables a fraction of the population to work at things not directly necessary to the maintenance of life; secondly, a moral tradition of respect for cultural values and achievements, in virtue of which this class is provided with the means of living by the other classes, those who provide the immediate necessities of life. For its defense this minority is resorting to every known legal method at its disposal. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. For large velocities the momentum increases more rapidly than linearly with the velocity, so as to become infinite on approaching the velocity of light.
For let K' be a system of co-ordinates whose z'-axis coincides with the z-axis of K, and which rotates about the latter axis with constant angular velocity. For looked at from a simple human point of view, moral conduct does not mean merely a stern demand to renounce some of the desired joys of life, but rather a sociable interest in a happier lot for all men. For many facts, the simpler theory gives an explana- tion and the refinement seems unnecessary. For me it is not dubious that our thinking goes on for the most part without use of signs (words) and beyond that to a considerable degree unconsciously.
For meetings between the statesmen of two nations at a time, which have become very frequent of late, have been used to prepare the ground for the Conference by conversations about the disarmament problem. For more than ten years I spent my leisure hours during the summer months with him, mostly on his delightful yacht. For more than two decades physicists tried vainly to find I a unif orm interpretation of this "quantum character" of sys? For nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced. For one can hardly assert that the moral aspect of human life in genera!
For one elementary particle, electron or photon, we have probability waves in a three-dimensional con- tinuum, characterizing the statistical behaviour of the system if the experiments are often repeated. For owing to habit and speech his real person? For owing to the alteration in direction of the velocity of revolution of the earth in the course of a year, the earth cannot be at rest relative to the hypothetical system K0 throughout the whole year. For physical reasons (no slipping) it is assumed that for symmetrical dilatations in all directions, i.e. For pure logie all axioms are arbitrary, including the axioms of ethics. For reasons of symmetry it is clear that a circle around the origin in the X, Y piane of K may at the same time be regarded as a circle in the X', Y' plane of K'.
For reasons which I do not propose to analyse here, the majority of people are compelled to work for the minimum wage on which life can be supported. For reasons which I do not propose to analyze bere, the ma? For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. For scienti:fic endeavor is a natural wbole the parts of which mutually support one another in a way wbicb, to be sure, no one can anticipate. For scientific endeavor is a natural whole, the parts of which mutually support one another in a way whicb, to be sure, no one can anticipate. For severa!decades most physicists clung to the conviction that a mechanical substructure would be found for Maxwell's theory.
For since electrical masses of one sign repel each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron would necessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating between them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.1) If we now assume that the relative distances between the electrical masses constituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of the electron (rigid connection in the sense of classical mechanics), we arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree with experience. For such a point, the associative law (AB) S=A(BS) holds, where S is a third matrix which has got as many horizontal rows as B (or x-VB) has got vertical columns.
For such an infinitely small region there will be an inertial system (with the space co-ordinates, Xl, X2, X3, and the time co-ordinate X4) relatively to which we are to regard the laws of the special theory of relativity as valid. For such regions we obtain, by forming the scalar, - G + 4 >= O. For tbe potentia.l g,..., both indices of which differ from 4, we ha.ve to set (12). For tbe theoretical conception of electric and magnetic pbenomena one introduced, again, masses of a special kind, and between tbese masses one assumed the existence of forces acting at a distance, similar to Newton's gravitational forces.
For tbe transverse journey the light must have a compo- nent velocity n up-stream (relative to the ether) in order to avoid beins: carried below OB : and since its total velocity is c, its component across-stream must be \/{c'^ u'^), the time for the double journey OB is accordingly t'l = /7-~^^ = A SO that t^>t^. For tbese quantities are, of course, the energy-components in the sense of the special theory of relativity, in which variable g. do not occur. For that community is not, and must never become, a political one; this is the only permanent source whence it can draw new strength and the only ground on which its existence can be justified. For the Prussian Academy of Sciences, (Signed) H. von Ficker, E. Heymann, Perpetual Secretaries.
For the absorption process Zm->Zn, the momentum transfer has the same magnitude, but is in the opposite direction. For the ad- herent of the Copernican system it was thus as good as certain that this must also apply to the orbits of the rest of the planets. For the best court of justice is meaningless unless it is backed by the au? For the best results the source should be a strong one.
For the case in which the points of the surface considered form a Euclidean continuum with reference to the measuring-rods, but only in this case, it is possible to draw the u-curves and v-curves and to attach numbers to them, in such a manner, that we simply have : ds2 = du2 + dv2 Under these conditions, the u-curves and v-curves are straight lines in the sense of Euclidean geometry, and they are perpendicular to each other. For the case of bodies at rest, i.e. For the case where the force is directed against the motion, where the motion is slowed down, the diagram is somewhat different.
For the case where the molecule is acted upon simultaneously by several radiation bundles, we assume that total energy emen associated with an elementary process is removed from, or added to, a single such radiation bundle. For the ce.lcule.tion Irefer to the origine.I pe.pers : A. Einstein, Sitzungsber. For the concept of space the following seems essential. For the contraction is not to be thought of as a consequence of the resistance of ether, but purely as a gift from the skies, as a sort of eundition always accompanying a state of motion. For the contravariant energy-tensor T"v of ponderable matter is given by where p is the density of matter in natural measure. For the definition of simultaneous events, the clocks are synchronized by the help of signals.

For the determinant of A) it follows out of (39) that (DetA)- = 1;, or Det A=-}-l.

For the elementary quantum of electricity, Rutherford and Geiger obtained the mean value 4.65 x 10-10, Regener 4.79 x 10-10, while Planck, using his radiation theory, determined the intermediate value 4.69 x 10-10 from the constants of the radiation formula.
For the entropy S of this state, BoltzmannOs theorem provides the expression (5). For the essential in the being of a man of my type lies precisely in what he thinks and how he thinks, not in what he does or suffers. For the first time there appears a force quite different from that to which, according to our mechanical point of view, we intended to reduce all actions in the external world. For the function of setting up goals and passing statements of value transcends its domain. For the gravitation-potential we get from (67) and (68) the exp. For the idealized experiment we may imagine that someone has learned to eliminate entirely the friction which always accompanies motion. For the indices 1 and 4 we obtain, in an analogous manner, ?x'1 = x1 cos??
For the inertia of a material point of mass ni (in natural measure) depends upon the g.v ; but these differ but little from their postulated values, as given above, for spatial infinity. For the infinitesimal region surrounding the point P1, there is, according to our way of considering the matter, a co-ordinate system of the X? For the inside observer the two bodies remain exactly where they were when he let them go. For the last year Lorentz has presided over the Commission, which, with the active support of its subordinate, the Paris Institute, is to act as a go-between in the domain of intellectual and artistic work among the various spheres of culture.
For the last year Lorentz has presided over the Committee, which, with the active support of its subordinate, the Paris Institute, is to act as a go-between in the domain of intellectual and artistic activity among the various spheres of culture. For the latter God is a being from whose care one hopes to benefit and whose punishment one fears; a sublimation of a feeling similar to that of a child for its father, a being to whom one stands to some extent in a personal relation, however deeply it may be tinged with awe. For the latter considerable sums have been collected during these months in America, thanks to the indefatigable labours of Professor Weizmann and other Zionist leaders, chiefly through the self-sacrificing spirit of the middle classes.
For the latter, God is a being from whose care one hopes to benefit and whose punishment one fears; a sublimation of a feeling similar to that of a child for its father, a being to whom one stands, so to peak, in a personal relation, however deeply it may be tinged with awe. For the laws governing this transition, we introduce a few hypotheses which are obtained by carrying over the known situation for a Planck resonator in classical theory to the as yet unknown one in quantum theory. For the laws of geometry, even according to the special theory of relativity, are to be interpreted directly as laws relating to the possible relative positions of solid bodies at rest ; and, in a more genera!
For the logical structure of the latter would undoubtedly be more satisfactory without this shadowy concept; in that case only things whose relations to perception are perfectly clear (mass-points, distances) would enter into the laws. For the main part, however, this modification affects only the laws for rapid motions, in which the velocities of matter v are not very small as compared with the velocity of light. For the measurement of vectors in different directions^ the unit measuring rod is to be fixed in the following manner;a space-like vector from to F = I is always to have the measure unity, and a time-like vector from O to +F= 1 , />0 is always to have the measure .
For the mechanical behaviour of a corporeal system hovering freely in empty space depends not only on relative positions (distances) and relative velocities, but also on its state of rotation, which physically may be taken as a characteristic not appertaining to the system in itself. For the mo- ment the one important thing was the discovery that a reasonable theory of gravitation could only be hoped for from an extension of the principle of relativity. For the mo- ment, therefore, we shall assume both the carrying of the ether by the room moving with its light source and the classical transformation. For the modern physicist the entire problem of deciding between corpuscles and waves again exists, this time in a much more profound and intricate form. For the moment he is, in fact, right.
For the moment, all the lines of force, or briefly speaking, the field, indicate only how a test body would behave if brought into the vicinity of the sphere for which the field is constructed. For the moment, this is merely a name and there is no reason for stress- ing it further. For the moral attitudes of a people that is supported by religion need always aim at preserving and promoting the sanity and vitality of the co=unity and its individuals, since otherwise this community is bound to perish. For the most part I do the thing which my own nature drives me to do. For the motion was only deter- mined by the equation of motion in cases where the force was given.
For the origin of K1 we have permanently x' = 0, and hence according to the first of the equations (5) If we call v the velocity with which the origin of K1 is moving relative to K, we then have The same value v can be obtained from equations (5), if we calculate the velocity of another point of K1 relative to K, or the velocity (directed towards the negative x-axis) of a point of K with respect to K'. For the outside observer, who is looking through the window of the lift, both handkerchief and watch fall toward the ground in exactly the same way, with the same acceleration. For the perpendicular to a plane, we now have not a sini^le line, but an infinite number of lines constitutimG^; a plane.
For the physicist of the early nineteenth century, the reality of our outer world consisted of particles with simple forces acting between them and depending only on the distance. For the presence of our molecules would otherwise disturb the thermal equilibrium between the thermal radiation and an arbitrary gas held at the same temperature. For the present basic investigation, a detailed determination of the quantum states is not required. For the present one cannot even know whether regular solutions with morc than one bridge exist at all. For the present we shall assume the "truth" of the geometrical propositions, then at a later stage (in the general theory of relativity) we shall see that this "truth" is limited, and we shall consider the extent of its limitation.
For the present, however, we have not the necessary array of facts to test the legitimacy of our introduction of the postu- lated principle. For the quantities 'which figure in its laws make no claim to describe physical reality itself, but only the probabilities of the occurrence of a physical reality that we have in view, Dirac, to whom, in my opinion, we owe the most logically complete exposi- tion of this theory, rightly points out that it would probably be difficult, for example, to give a theoretical description of a photon such as would give enough information to enable one to decide whether it will pass a polarizer placed (obliquely) in its way or not.
For the reflected light, referring the process to system k, we obtain A00 = A0 cos?00 = ?cos?0 ?00 = ?0 Finally, by transforming back to the stationary system K, we obtain for the reflected light A, . For the relative orientation in space of the coordinate systems indicated in the diagram (Fig. For the relative orientation of the co-ordinate systems indicated in Fig.
For the sake of clearness the indivi- dual branches of this hyperbola will be called the " Inter- hi/perbola with centra- 0^ Such a hyperbolic branch, when thought of as a world-line, would represent a motion which for /= oo and t = oo^ asymptotically approaches the velocit}^ of light c. If, by way of analogy to the idea of vectors in space, we call any directed length in the manifoldness i',^,z,l a vector, then we have to distinguish between a time-vector directed from O towards the sheet +F=1, ^>Oand a space-vector directed from O towards the sheet F=l. For the sake of simplicity, in the discussion that foIIows I shaII caII "workers" aII those who do not share in the owner?
For the same reason an Eskimo and a native of some equatorial coun- try meeting in New York on a spring day would hold different opinions as to whether the climate was hot or cold. For the scientifc method can teach us nothing else beyond how facts are related to, and conditioned by, each other. For the scientist, there is only "'being,"butno wishing, no valuing, no good, no evil; no goal. For the second of these tasks he receives an admirable equipment at school. For the space under consideration they then vanish, also in any other systern of co-ordinates. For the sum of all substitutions in any case in? For the theoretician such an asymmetry in the theoretical structure, with no corresponding asymmetry in the system of experience, is intolerable.
For the theory in its basic principles is not an atomic one in so far as it operates exclusively with continuous functions of space, in contrast to classical mechanics whose most important feature, the material point, squares with the atomistic structure of matter. For the theory is fundamentally non-atomic in so far as it operates exclusively with continuous functions of space, in contrast to classical mechanics, whose most impor- tant element, the material point, in itself does justice to the atomic structure of matter. For the time being, however, we shall assume its correctness. For the time being, we bave to admit that we do not possess any generai theoretical basis for physics, which can be regarded as its logica!foundation.
For the time being, we disregard the radiation emitted and absorbed by the oscillators and inquire into the condition of dynamical equilibrium associated with the interaction (or collision) of molecules and electrons. For the time being, we shall continue to believe that the ether is a medium through which electromagnetic waves, and thus also light waves, are propagated, even though we are fully aware of the many difficulties connected with its mechanical structure. For the transition from one Galileian system to another, which is moving uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of the Lorentz transformation are valid. For the transitions of these states into one another-with or with? For the transposed matrix of .C = BA, we have C = BA ^2 PRInCIPIE of feELATlVltr S*^.
For the value of d a certain probability-law will hold ; the' number d% of the particles which experience in the time- interval r a displacement which lies between d and d + dA, will be expressed by an equation of the form where dn = n+(A)d& [+OO+(A)dd -00 = I and + only differs from zero for very small values of d and fulfils the condition 14 THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT We will investigate now how the coefficient of diffusion depends on 4, confining ourselves again to the case when the number V of the particles per unit volume is dependent only on x and t. Putting for the number of particles per unit volume V = f(x, t), we will calculate the distri- bution of the particles at a time t + T from the distribution at the time t. From the definition of the function +(A), there is easily obtained the number of the particles which are located at the.
For the velocity v=c we should have , and for stiII greater velocities the square-root becomes imaginary. For them nothing exists outside of this plane: that which they observe to happen to themselves and to their flat " things " is the all-inclusive reality of their plane. For then clocks, similar to one another, and regulated alike, could be distributed over the systems K and K', at rest relatively to them, and their indications would be independent of the state of motion of the systems; the time of an event would then be given by the clock in its immediate neighbourhood. For there is a finite ratio of densities corresponding to the finite difference of potential between tbe centre and spatial infinity.
For there is presupposed a mysterious property of physical space, conditioning the kind of coordi? For these must not exist independently of the field but are to be treated as part of it. For these people any sphere of human ac- tivity will do, if it comes to a point; whether they become officers, tradesmen or scientists depends on circumstances. For these reasons it was necessary to raise to the degree of a principle, the validity of the law o c?nstancy of light velocity for all inertial systems. For these reasons writers have occasionally noted the possibility that material particles might be considered as singularities of the field.
For these reasons, we should be on our guard not to over- estimate science and scientific methods when it is a question of human problems; and we should not assume that experts are the only ones who have a right to express themselves on questions affecting the organization of society. For these rules, or laws of na? For these systems, the four co-ordinates x, y, z, t, which determine an event or N in other words, a point of the four-dimensional continuum N are defined physically in a simple manner, as set forth in detail in the first part of this book. For this case we obtain We might also have obtained the formula for V, for the case when v and w have the same direction, by compounding two transformations in accordance with 3.
For this claim-if only carried through consistently absolutely excludes thinking of any kind as "metaphysical." For this fear seems to me, for example, to be the cause for conceiving of the "thing" as a "bundle of qualities," such that the "qualities" are to be taken from the sensory raw-material. For this field we have) everywhere : + '! For this gathering is an outward and visible sign that the world is no longer prone to regard material power and wealth as the highest goods. For this it is necessary and sufficient that the number of elementary processes of type (B) taking place per unit time should, on average, be equal to those of type (A) and (B') taken together.
For this last mentioned province of physics, the ques- tion may be asked : if there is a force with the components X, Y, Z (in the direction of the space-axes) at a world- point (c? For this latter case, however, a glance on the right hand side of (26) will show that we have only to bring forth the proof for the case when Now the right hand side of (25) maltiplied by i/^ is which has a tensor character. For this preliminary step should be taken ':ith ?onc1ous awareness that the ultimate goal is the denationalization of military power altogether. For this probability, which is a Ostatistical probabilityO, one obviously obtains: W = (v/v0)n; By applying the Boltzmann Principle, one then obtains S ?
For this purpose let us suppose that we have two systems, I and II, which we permit to inter- act from the time t=0 to t= T, after which time we suppose that there is no longer any interaction between the two parts. For this purpose we carry through an infinitesima!
For this purpose we have to exp'fess in equations the fact that t is not other than the time given by the clocks which are at rest in the system k which must be made synchron- ous in the manner described in L Let a ray of light be sent at time r^ from the origin of the system A,- along the- X-axis towards iv' and let it be reflected from that place at time t^ towards the origin of moving co-ordinates and let it arrive there at time t^ ; then we must have 10 PRINCIPLE OF REI ATIVITY If we now introduce the condition that t is a function (?f co-orrdinates, and apply the principle of constancy of the velocity of light in the stationary system, we have i ]t (o, o, 0, t)+T (o, 0, 0, {t+ il + J!__ [ ) 1 C cv c-{-v -) / J =T(a;', 0, 0,t + -^ ) C V /.
For this purpose we have to know the relative positions of the two co-ordinate sys- tems in question at every moment. For this purpose we introduce a third system of co-ordinates K0, which relatively to the system k is in a state of parallel translatory motion parallel to the axis of X, such that the origin of co-ordinates of system k moves with velocity ?v on the axis of X. For this purpose we must choose the acceleration of the infinitely small (" locai ") system of co-ordinates so that no gravitational field occurs ; this is possible for an infinitely small region. For this purpose we must first realize how the (turbulent) distribution of velocities takes place and is maintained. For this purpose we regard H as a function of the g"'" and the g"'; ( = ":Jg"'/":J x ..).
For this purpose we require a " distance " (rod S) which is to be used once and for all, and which we employ as a standard measure. For this purpose we suppose that clocks of identical construction are placed at the points A, B and C of the railway line (co-ordinate system) and that they are set in such a manner that the positions of their pointers are simultaneously (in the above sense) the same. For this purpose we will first give our attention once more to the geometry of two-dimensional spherical surfaces. For this purpose, let us consider H as a function of g^^ and g^^' I :- ^ We have at first a (T 8H=r" r^ 8/^+2/Y'' sr^ ix(3 va fji^ va = -r" r'^s,r+2r"ga( rrr'^) va But <rrry= -1 3[rr. For this purpose, we would first establish the general co-variant differential equations.
For this reason I am not at all anxious to take sides in the struggle between the followers of the classica!philologic-historical education and the education more devoted to natural science. For this reason I have always been passionately opposed to systems such as we see in Italy and Russia to-day. For this reason I have never been able to understand the quest of the a priori in the Kantian sense. For this reason Mach's attempt at a solution failed for the time being. For this reason a theory can only be regarded as justified when it is able to show that the impulses transmitted by the radiation field to matter lead to motions that are in accordance with the theory of heat.
For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable definition of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest with respect to the body of reference. For this reason non-rigid reference-bodies are used, which are as a whole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but which also suffer alterations in form ad lib. For this reason we bave here deduced it from the requirement that the energy of the gravitat10nal field shall act gravitatively in tbe same way as any other kind of energy. For this reason we can perform optical experi- ments in an ordinary room with the same effect as if there were no air. For this reason you, Herr Solf, have devoted a portion of your energies to Lessing College, and we are grateful to you for doing so.
For this reason, I believe that the next phase in the development of theoretical physics will bring us a theory of light that can be considered a fusion of the oscillation and emission theories. For this reason, in what immediately follows we shall speak only of the equations of the pure gravitational field. For this specialization of the choice of co-ordinates brings about the vanishing of si'., so that the tensor Gl'V reduces to R,... On this account I shall hereafLer give all relations in the simpJified form which this speci:iJ;zation of the choice of co?
For this theory revealed that it was possible for us, using basic principles very far removed from those of Newton, to do justice to the entire range of the data of experience in a manner even more complete and satisfactory than was possible with Newton's principles. For this there is just as little a uni?
For this value of t we then obtain from the first of the equations (5) x' = ax Two points of the x'-axis which are separated by the distance _x' = I when measured in the K1 system are thus separated in our instantaneous photograph by the distance But if the snapshot be taken from K'(t' = 0), and if we eliminate t from the equations (5), taking into account the expression (6), we obtain From this we conclude that two points on the x-axis separated by the distance I (relative to K) will be represented on our snapshot by the distance But from what has been said, the two snapshots must be identical; hence _x in (7) must be equal to _x' in (7a), so that we obtain The equations (6) and (7b) determine the constants a and b.
For this we apply the same method as employed in the fore- going paragraph for the deduction of the equations of motion for material points. For this we are all devoutly grateful to you, and also to fate, which along with grievous plagues has also given us the physician and liberator of our souls. For this we shall make use of a method which is well known from the theory of Brownian motion, and which I employed on several occasions for numerical computations of motions in a radiation field. For this, we need only insert the values for A%\x and R determined by (25) and (21), after replacing in (21) the expression (e-i"-^-) by ghvf3kT, from (4). For tl1is claim-if only carried tl1rough consistently?
For to each original figure on K there is a corresponding shadow figure on E. If two discs on K are touching, their shadows on E also touch. For to the discoverer in that field, the constructions of his imagination appear so necessary and so natural that he is apt to treat them not as the creations of his thoughts but as given realities. For two particles our question could be: what is the probability of meet- ing the two particles at two definite spots at a given instant? For two pieces of 3 -space volumes can always be added together by the vectorial addition of their com- ponents. For uniformly moving electrons, the corpuscular language is already known. For us, who took in Faraday's ideas so to speak with our mother's milk, it is hard to appreciate their greatness and audacity.
For v = c all moving objectsNviewed from the OstationaryO systemNshrivel up into plane figures.For velocities greater than that of light our deliberations become meaningless; we shall, however, find in what follows, that the velocity of light in our theory plays the part, physically, of an infinitely great velocity. For we can assume from a representation by the aid of a Euclidean system of local co-ordinates that the same parallelogram will be described by the displacement of an element d(1)x? For we can still select the orientation of the n-legs perfectly freely without causing any alteration in the result of calculating the size of the linear ele- ments according to Pythagorass theorem.
For we had only formulated our hypotheses on emission and absorption for the case of stationary molecules. For we imagine tbat there may be a piace in universal space round about which the gravitational feld of matter, viewed on a large scale, possesses spherical symmetry. For we may picture the field to ourselves as consisting of lines of force. For what could be more characteristic of the level of political morality and righteousness than the attitude of the nations toward a defenseless minority whose peculiarity it is to preserve its ancient traditions of culture? For what purpose has this book been written?
For what surer index of political morality and respect for justice can there be than the attitude of the nations towards a defenceless minority, whose peculiarity lies in their preservation of an ancient cultural tradition? For whatever the shape of a future theory of the electromagnetic processes, the Doppler principle and the aberration law will at all events remain preserved, and hence also eqs. For when viewed with a good microscope they still appear blue and yellow interspersedly. For whereas formerly it was enough for a man to have freed himself to some extent from personal egotism to make him a valuable member of society, to-day he must also be required to overcome national and class egotism.
For whereas they previously had required of a conclusive theory that it should content itself with the fundamental concepts which belong exclusively to mechanics (e.g. For while religion prescribes brotherly love in the relations 52 IDEAS AND OPINIONS among the individuals and groups, the actual spectacle more resembles a battlefield than an orchestra. For with^ this method of calculation Planck introduced the quantum hypothesis into physics, which has since received brilliant confirma- tion. For without the active co-operation of the great country of the United States in the business of regulating international relations, all efforts directed towards this important end are bound to remain more or less ineffectual. For work which is directly productive of material wealth they will pay.
For you will say to yourselves, 'The lecturer is himself a constructive physicist; on his own showing therefore he should leave the consideration of the structure of theoretical science to the epistemologist'. For, by hypothesis, for any substitution, A'O"l'B'O'T = AvB'". For, from the standpoint of the Lorentz- group two solutions would incorrectly have to be viewed as physically dif- ferent from each other, if they can be transformed into each other by a non-linear transformation of coordi- nates, i.e., if they are, from the point of view of the wider field, only dif- ferent representations of the same field.
For, however brief and limited one's working life may be, and however pre- dominant may be the ways of error, the exposition of that which is worthy of communication does nonetheless not come easy N today's person of sixty-seven is by no means the same as was the one of fifty, of thirty, or of twenty. For, if C"' is any four-vector, then on account of the tensor haracter of AvB" , the inner product AvB"C" is a scalar for any choice of the two four-vectors B" and 0". For, if one doubts the pbysical mode of though t in even its most genera!
For, if one doubts the physical mode of thought in even its most general features, there is no necessity to interpolate between the object and the act of vision anything which separates the object from the subject and makes the "existence of the object" problematical. For, if such an agreement would be achieved then these two powers alone would be able to cause the other nations to give up their sovereignty to the degree necessary for the establish? For, if we do so, the following terms of the expression for A,n- canee! For, if we now assume the special theory of relativity to apply to a certain four-dimensional region with the co-ordinates properly chosen, then the gu,,.
For, so long as we do not achieve supranational military security, the above-mentioned factors can always and forcibly lead us into war. For, super- REMARKS ON BERTR.AND R.USSELL'S THEORY OF KNOWLRDGE 21 ficially considered, the mode of thought in Berkeley and Hume seems to stand in contrast to the mode of thought in the natural sciences. For, superficially considered, the mode of thought in Berkeley and Hume seems to stand in contrast to the mode of thought in the natural sciences. For- tunately, it is quite unnecessary; mathematics furnishes a short cut, and makes possible precise description of the motion in much less ink than we use for a single sentence. Force and change of velocity are vectors having the same direction.
Force, as we know, is a vector, and to determine it we must know its direction as well as its length. Formally, it has the same rTMle in the four-dimensional space-time continuum as the invariant x12 + x22 + x32 in the Euclidean geometry and in the pre-relativity physics. Formally, these four co-ordinates correspond exactly to the three space co-ordinates in Euclidean geometry. Formally, this depends upon the fact that the quantities (x? Formation of Tensors through Differentiation. Forming the divergence of (la), and taking into account that the divergence of G"v - g"vG vanishes, we obtain (4a). Formula (5) can be derived from Boltzmann's principle, or from purely thermodynamical considerations. Fot these very same reasons there is a constant danger that un?
Four definite numbers correspond to every event; a definite event corresponds to any four numbers. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected president in spite of desperate opposition by these very powerf ul groups and was reelected three times; and this took place at a time when decisions of great consequence had to be made. Frankly, I can only see the revolutionary way of non-co? Frankly, the idea strikes me as horrible. Frequently such a situation has produced a harsh and dismal egoism. FresneVs convection coefficient /(:=1 ^/^^.Possibb some form of compensation is taking place.
Fresnel's stagnant ether requires a relative velocity of n. Thus Michelson and Morlev themselves thought at first that their experiment conhrmed Stokes^ viscous ether, in wliieh no relative motion can ensue on account of the absence of slip])ing of ether at the surface of separation. Friends have already Subscribed nearly $400,000.00 of the one million dollars we need to carry out our minimum program. From (12) and (13) it also follows that the free energy F of the system is given by . From (1a) one easily deduces that (8). From (2) we obtain, for such variations e.s are of interest to us, so that we may replace our principle of variation (1) by tbe more convenient form sJ *dr = o. .
From (43) we obtain, by differentiating by the time l, and using the principle of momentum, in the notation of threedimensional vectors, K = dld ? From (5. a), it follows at once that the sums (A 4 ^ ) ^^^ ^^so com- ponents of a four-vector, when A^ and B*^ are so ; cor- responding relations hold also for all systems afterwards introduced as " tensors " (Rule of addition and subtraction of Tensors). From (5a) it follows at on ce that the sums A" B" are also components of a four-vector, if A" and B" are such. From (63) a.od (65) we ha.ve in the first pia.ce The second term of the right-hand side, by rea.son of (60), permits the transformation p.v() = - tF.v()() = - tgP.g F,,/i) v which latter expression may, for reasons of symmetry, also a be written in the form.

From (ril), we can deduce the law for the motion of a material point, 2".^., the law for the career of an infinitely thin space-time filament. From 1860 the identitv of lisht as an electromagnetic vector became o-radualh' established as a result of the brilliant '^ displacement current" hypothesis of Clerk Maxwell and his further analytical investigations.
From 78) we obtain /F=-F*/*-2L; hence the second part of lor / F = (lor F*)/*+ the part of 2 lor L, in which the differentiations operate upon the components of F alone We thus obtain lor S= ( lor / ) F- (lor F* )/* + N, where N is the vector with the components N, =:JL / Q/23 F JL. From Newton' s time on, the theory of action-at-a-distance was constantly found artificial. From Riemann's investigations on metric spaces the mathematical properties of this gik field can be given exactly ("Riemann-condition") . From Wien's displacement law (1) it follows immediately that An - ~ = <*"3 (8) and m en = hv, (9) where a and h are universal constants. From a "happening" in three-dimensional space, physics becomes, as it were, an " existence " in the four-dimensional " world."
From a formal point of view one may char? From a practical point of view it is still good for small velocities, but not for settling fundamental physical questions. From a systematic theoretical point of view, we may imagine the process of evolution of an empirical science to be a continuous process of induction. From a tensor of rank ?and a tensor of rank ? From all of these considerations, space and time data have a physically real, and not a mere fictitious, significance; in particular this holds for all the relations in which co-ordinates and time enter, e.g. From amongst these, the spherical space (and the elliptical) excels in its simplicity, since all points on it are equivalent. From both these relations it follows as a first approxi- mation that (71) ,l" = l- ^ .
From every mixed tensor we can tret a tensor which is two ranks lower, when we put an index of eo-variant character equal to an index of the contravariant character and sum according to these indices (Reduction). From it, we can prove in the simplest way all laws which hold true for the tensor of the second rank defined through (9), by proving it only for the special tensor of the type (8). From now on we shall not use the classical transformation because we know that it contradicts our assumptions. From our argument we see why the solution of the gravitational problem will differ in classical physics and general relativity. From our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a general theory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of gravitation.
From our point of view this means : The law governing the properties of the gravitational field in space must be a perfectly definite one, in order correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action with the distance from operative bodies. From photographs of this kind the wave-lengths of the X-ray spectra can be calculated and, on the other hand, if the wave-length is known, conclusions can be drawn about the structure of the crystal. From reasons of symmetry it is now evident that the length of a given rod moving perpendicularly to its axis, measured in the stationary system, must depend only on the velocity and not on the direction and the sense of the motion. From such a deviation it could be proved indirectly that the universe is finite.
From tbis it follows in the first piace tbat the radiation emitted by tbe heavenly bodies will, in part, leave tbe Newtonian system of the universe, passing radially outwards, to become ineffective and lost in the infinite. From the above assumption, in combination with the principle of relativity, it is clear that in the immediately ensuing time (for small values of t) the electron, viewed from the system k, moves in accordance with the equations , , in which the symbols ?, ?, ?, X0, Y0, Z0 refer to the system k. If, further, we decide that when t = x = y = z = 0 then ? From the age of twelve to six- teen I familiarized myself with the elements of mathematics together with the principles of differential and integral calculus.
From the consideration with respect to K0 we know that the velocity v of B remains unchanged by the absorption of S and S'. From the considerations in 2 and H it is clear, that from the physical stand-point the quantities g are to be looked upon as magnitudes wliich describe the gravita- tion-field with reference to the chosen system of axes. From the considerations of 2 and 3 it follows that the quantities Ynr are to be regarded from the physical stand? From the considerations of the previous section the answer is self-evident. From the definition of T, we see that the fourth simply expresses the " Ener2:y-law.'" From the deliberations in 4 it follows that the quantity e?A, which we shall denote as ?, is smaller than 1.
From the energy principle it must follow that the energy level of an atom is higher before emission and lower afterwards, and that the difference between the two levels must be equal to the energy of the emitted photon. From the equation for ?0 it follows that if an observer is moving with velocity v relatively to an infinitely distant source of light of frequency ?, in such a way that the connecting line Osource-observerO makes the angle ? From the equations of the general theory of relativity it can be deduced that this total reduction of inertia to reciprocal action between masses as required by E. Mach, for example is possible only if the universe is spatially finite.
From the equations of the general theory of relativity it can be deduced that this total reduction of inertia to reciprocal action between massesas required by E. Mach, for exampleis possible only if the universe is spatially finite. From the expressions (83), we obtain, (85) S - 8"= - (c /x - 1) , from which we deduce that . From the expressions (83), we obtain, (85) S - 8"= - (c /x - 1) [w, 12], from which we deduce that . From the expressions far the momentum, it follows that m A plays the part of the rest mass. From the extremely rich variety of motions we shall take only the simplest and apply to their explanation the law just formulated. From the field equations of (^gravitation, it also follows that the conservation-laws of impulse and energy are satisfied.
From the foregoing it is evident that the equations of transformation (3), (4) have a fundamental significance in Euclidean geometry, in that they govern the transformation from one Cartesian system of co-ordinates to another. From the general quantum assumption for matter, Bohr's second postulate (eq. From the investigations of Lenard and Ladenburg, the curious discovery was made that this maximum velocity of emission did not at all depend upon the intensity of light, but upon its wavelength. From the known law of transformation for the ?
From the latest results of the theory of relativity it is probable that our three- dimensional space is also approximately spherical, that is, that the laws of disposition of rigid bodies in it are not given by Euclidean geometry, but approximately by spherical geometry, if only we consider parts of space which are sufficiently great. From the latest results of the theory of relativity it is probable that our three-dimensional space is also approximately spherical, that is, that the laws of disposition of rigid bodies in it are not given by Euclidean geometry, but approximately by spherical geometry, if only we consider parts of space which are sufficiently great.
From the latter, general mathematical conditions issued, to which natural laws had to conform, if the above-mentioned two principles were really to apply. From the measure- ments of the inside observer he can deduce the velocity of sound relative to his c.s. From the method adopted here, the ease of the usual relativity theory comes out when owing to the special behaviour of ff in 2i> finite region it is possible to choose the system of co-ordinates in such a way that g assumes eonstanf values 1, 0, 0, {*) 0-100 0-10 0+1 Wfe would afterwards see that the choice of such a system of co-ordinates for a finite region is in general not possible.
From the origin of system k let a ray be emitted at the time ?0 along the X-axis to x0, and at the time ?1 be reflected thence to the origin of the coordinates, arriving there at the time ?2; we then must have , or, by inserting the arguments of the function ? From the physical point of view this simply means that the laws of mechanics cannot be applied to these c.s., that they are " bad" c.s. From the physical point of view, the only difference between an ordinary electromag- netic wave and a light wave is the wave-length: this is very small for light waves, detected by the human eye, and great for ordinary electromagnetic waves, detected by a radio receiver.
From the physicist's point of view it is advantageous to say that the velocities of the two spheres moving in different directions are different. From the physicist's point of view, the centrai importance of Euclidian geometry rests in the fact that its laws are inde? From the point of view of classical physics the two pictures, the dynamic and the static, are equivalent. From the point of view of the aim of the greatest logica!simplicity of the foundations, this theoretical method is deficient in so far as the laws of farce cannot be obtained by logica! From the point of view of the new theory it is clear in which cases classical physics is valid and wherein its limitations lie.
From the point of view of the relativity theory a material body cannot have a velocity greater than that of light. From the point of view of the relativity theory the old concepts seem arbitrary. From the point of view of the special theory of relativity the ether hypothesis does certainly seem an empty one at first sight. From the point of view of theories of knowledge St. Mill and E. Mach took their stand approximately on this ground. From the present state of theory it looks as if the electromagnetic field, as opposed to the gravitational field, rests upon an entirely new formal motif, as though nature might just as well have endowed the gravitational ether with fields of quite another type, for example, with fields of a scalar potential, instead of fields of the electromagnetic type.
From the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light it follows that the equation x?2 = 0 has a significance which is independent of the choice of the inertial system; but the invariance of the quantity x?2 does not at all follow from this. From the purely kinematic point of view there was no doubt about the relativity of all motions whatever ; but physically speaking, the inertial system seemed 78 to occupy a privileged position, which made the use of co-ordinate systems moving in other ways appear artificial. From the second of equations A) ; it follows that an electrical force Y, and a magnetic force N produce equal deflexions of an electron moving with the velocity V, when Y= .
From the second of equations A) we obtain : N These three relations are complete expressions for the law of motion of the electron according to the above theory. From the second of the equations (A) we obtain or R = . From the standpoint of Eqs (3) the hyperplane x&=0 then represents a singularity of the field. From the standpoint of energy this is the chain of transformations which are taking place: chemical energy -> energy of the flowing electric fluid, i.e., the current -> heat. From the standpoint of mechanics it appears that equivalent spaces of reference do exist.
From the standpoint of the original theory the solution (1) contains a singularity which corresponds to an energy or mass concentrated in the surface x& 0; from the standpoint of the modified theory, how- ever, (1) is a solution of (3a), free from singulari- ties, which describes the "field-producing mass, " without requiring for this the introduction of any new field quantities, the smaller o()0) is chosen, the nearer does this gravitational field come to that of (1). From the study of history, one is inclined to regard religion and science as irreconcilable antagonists, and this for a reason that is very easily seen. From the tensor character of Au-r - A-ru in conjunction with the fact tbat Ap is an arbitrary vector, it follows, by reason of 7, that B,,.,.
From the tensor-character of A A , and from the fact that A is an arbitrary four vector, it follows, on account of the result of 7, that B ^ is a tensor (Iliemann-Christoft'el Tensor). From the two identities (16) and (17), which result from the invariance of @ , and therefore from the postulate of general relativity, we now bave to draw conclusions. From the value which is deduced for the kinetic energy of the electron, it follows that when the electron falls through a potential difference of P, the velocity v which is acquired is given by the following relation : 3. From the variety of complex motions in the world around us we choose as our first example uniform mo- tion.
From the very beginning it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of such an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest. From the viewpoint of the political mentality prevailing at present, it may seem illusory, even fantastic, to hope for the realization of such conditions within a period of a few years.
From the well known Riemannian covariant of fourth rank, the following covariant of second rank is derived: Gim = Rim + Sim (1) Rim = -l {im l}/xl + l {il }{m l} (1a) Sim = l {il l}/xm l {im }{l l} (1b) We obtain the ten general covariant equations of the gravitational field in spaces, in which "matter" is absent, by putting: Gim = 0 (2) These equations can be formed in a simpler way, when one choses the reference system so that g = 1. From them we form, in accordance with (36), the components Fp.,. From these discussions we see, that the working out of the general relativity theory must, at the same time, lead to a theory of gravitation ; for we can " create " a gravitational field by a simple variation of the co-ordinate system. From these equation it follows that ?
From these n n( ?1) equations the 3n co-ordinates may be eliminated, and from this elimination 2 at least n n( ?1) ?3n equations in the s?will result.2 Since 2 the s? From these two equations we dra.w two inferences which are important for what follows. From these two relations follows: If now, as we find from experience, the acceleration is to be independent of the nature and the condition of the body and always the same for a given gravitational field, then the ratio of the gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all bodies. From these two relations it follows that, correct to a first order of small quantities, a dx = 1 - 2r .
From this condition one obtains from (5), (A), (B), (B') the equation pn exp (-enlkT)BTMQ = pm exp (~sm/kT)(Bls + A%) for the elementary processes associated with the index combination (m, n). From this consideration we see that it will be advantageous if, in the description of position, it should be possible by means of numerical measures to make ourselves independent of the existence of marked positions (possessing names) on the rigid body of reference. From this correspondence follows that it is irnpos? From this definition it follows that A?? From this easily follows the co-variance of Newton's equations of motion with respect to the Galilean transformation (21). From this example, and later from many others, we recognized the importance of the idealized experiment created by thought.
From this follows immediately the correctness of our assertion. From this follows that either (1) t'he guanturn- mechanical description of rea1ity given by the wave function is not cornplele or (2) when the operators corresponding .to two physical qlantities do not commute the two quantifies cannot have simul- taneous reality. From this follows the additivity of the entopies of the mixtureOs components. From this is follows immediately that the work of ionization (i.e., the work theoretically needed for ionization) of a molecule cannot be greater than the energy of an absorbed light quantum capable of producing this effect.
From this it follaws that the simultaneity of two distant events is not an invariant concept and that the dimensions of rigid bodies and the speed of clocks depend upon their state of motion. From this it follows inevitably that, with methods of production as they are today, only a por? From this it follows inevitably that, with methods of production what they are to-day, only a portion of the available labour can be used. From this it follows that for every choice of ? From this it follows that our function iv does not in any way de? From this it follows that the spectral lines of light reaching us from the surf ace of large stars must appear displaced towards the red end of "the spectrum".
From this it follows that there is no longer any reason for favoring, as a fundamental principle, the "inertial systems"; and, we must admit as equivalent in their own right, also non-linear transformations of the coordinates ( Xi, x2, x8, x4 ). From this it might seem as if logical thinking were irrele? From this last, let us form three special vectors of the lirst kind^ namely-^- B.=(B.,, B,,, B,;n B, = (B,.., B,,, B,,)KB,, B,., B,,=0). From this point of view, Copernicus' great achievement lies in transferring the c.s. From this special example one can already recognize that the immediate metric significance of the coordinates is lost if one admits non-linear transforma- tions of coordinates at all. From this there ensues the following peculiar consequence.
From this we can see that classica!mechanics must lead us to an atomistic construction of matter. From this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity c plays the part of a limiting velocity, which can neither be reached nor exceeded by any real body. From this we conclude, that, in general, rays of light are propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. From this we concluded: the length of the resting stick is one yard. From this we further conclude that: Monochromatic radiation of low density ( within the range of validity of WienOs radiation formula) behaves thermodynamically as though it consisted of a number of independent energy quanta of magnitude R??/N.
From this we readily discover, taking (7), (8), and (13) into account, that all equations (13a) are satisfied if the two relations or are fulfilled. From this we recognize first of all that the scalar of curvature G in the four-dimensional domains in wbicb tbe density of electncity vanishes, is constant. From this, however, it is already apparent that other components of the 911- must differ from the values given in (4) by small quantities of the first order. From this, it follows that the spacial coordinates Xi, X2, ,"Jf-3, and the time X4, u;be an? From this, one immediately obtains for the mean number of molecules per cell. From this, the following peculiar consequence follows.
From this, we conclude that a clock placed at the equator must be slower by a very &mall amount than a similarly constructed clock which is placed at the pole, all other conditions being identical. From what has already been said, this means complete neglect of the effects of gravitation. From what has been said it follows that, with the aid of the rules given above, the equation is co-variant with respect to orthogonal transformations in space (rotational transformations); and the rules according to which the quantities in the equation must be transformed in order that the equation may be co-variant also become evident. From what has been said it is clear that the word founda?
From what has now been said it wilI be seen that I bave not succeeded in formulatjng boundary conditions for spatial infinity. From what source shall I, as a partial layman in the reahn of pedagogy, derive courage to expound opinions with no foundations except persona!experience and persona! From what source shall I, as a partial layman in the realm of pedagogy, derive courage to expound opinions with no faundations except personal ex? From which by referring to (11), the thtorem at once follows. From which follows imme- diately that A = -M is a co-variant four-vector (gradient of ^). From which the proposition follows. From your magic box you have produced innumerable little figures which, while resembling human beings, are compact not of flesh and blood, but of brains, wit, and charm.
Frorn A. EINSTEIN 185 our assumption as to tbe uniformity of distribution of tbe masses generating tbe field, it follows that tbe curvature of the required space must be constant. Full of confidence in the real meaning of the space-time construction they developed the foundations of mechanics which we shall characterize, schematically, as follows: (a) ) Concept of a materiai point: a bodily object which? Fundamental Equations of E. Cohn. Fundamental hypothesis of quantum theory. Fundamental ideas play the most essential role in forming a physical theory. Fur an experimental proof, see a paper by C Majorana. Further I shall write for m,, m^, m,, ie ie , ie,. Further changes in the two concepts are connected with the theory of relativity.
Further consideration, together with a little mathematics, shows that the wave theory explanation is simpler and better, and that the consequences are in perfect agreement with observation. Further develop- ment leading to a much more profound theory of electricity gave an answer to this problem, which is quite meaningless when formulated in terms of the simple and primitive theory of electric fluids. Further it should be assumed that within the space- time reojion considered, a 's at infinite distances (using the word infinite in a spatial sense) can, by a suitable choice of co-ordinates, tend to the limiting values (4); i.e,, we con- sider only those gravitational fields which can be regarded as produced by masses distributed over finite regions.
Further let u denote the velocity vector of matter, e the dielectric constant, /u, the magnetic permeability, a- the conductivity of matter, while p denotes the density of electricity in space, and s the vector of "Electric Current" which we shall some across in 7 and 8. Further scientific advance, developing from the theory of relativity, shows that this new aspect should not be regarded as a malum necessarium, for the merits of the theory are much too marked. Further striving for logical unity brings us to a tertiary system, still poorer in concepts and relations, for the deduction of the concepts and relations of the second? Further striving for ty of choice, however, is of a special kind; it is not in any way similar to the liberty of a writer of fiction.
Further, I described the present state of affairs in Germany as a state of psychic distemper in the masses and also made some remarks about its causes. Further, as to the objection that there are no really rigid bodies in nature, and that therefore the properties predicated of rigid bodies do not apply to physical reality, this objection is by no means so radical as might appear from a hasty examination. Further, as to the objection that there are no really rigid bodies in nature, and that therefore the properties predicated of rigid bodies do not apply to physical reality,this objection is by no means so radical as might appear from a hasty examination. Further, every current is accompanied by a magnetic field.
Further, from g,,"g'" = o, it follows on differentiation that g,,"dg"' " - g"dg,,"} g From these, by mixed multiplication by g"T and g.... re? Further, from reasons of symmetry8 and therefore ? Further, in contemplating the immediate future of theoretical physics we ought not unconditionally to reject the possibility that the facts comprised in the quantum theory may set bounds to the field theory beyond which it cannot pass. Further, in those industries which have become monopolistic in character through organization on the part of the producers, prices must be controlled by the State in order to keep the creation of new capital within reasonable bounds and prevent the artificial strangling of production and consumption. Further, it follows that for two simultaneous events, x'?
Further, it is clear that a skew-symmetrical tensor of the third rank (skew-symmetrical in all pairs of indices) has only four independent components, since there are only four combinations of three different indices. Further, let a ray of light pass from one point P1, to another point P2 of K through a vacuum. Further, let be a funetion of tbe g1w, g1:;'( = ) and g ( = ;;.,),the %land q(p)a( = :1 . Further, let the time t of the stationary system be determined for all points thereof at which there are clocks by means of light signals in the manner indicated in 1; similarly let the time ? Further, let us examine the rate of a unit clock, which is arranged to be at rest in a static gravitational field.
Further, let us take at the same time t =o, two different space-points A, B, or three space-points (A, B, C) which are not in the same space-line, and compare therewith a space point P, which is outside the line A B, or the plane A B C^ at another time t, and let the time difference t t^ (t > t^) be less than the time which light requires for propogation from the line A B, or the plane A B 0) to P. Let q be the quotient of {t to) by the second time. Further, that the older people ought to be excluded from certain sorts of work (which I call "unqualified" work), receiving instead a certain incarne, as having by that time done enough work of a kind accepted by society as productive.

Further, the attitude of the Commission in the matter of combating the chauvinistic and militaristic tendencies of edu? Further, the attitude of the Commission in the matter of combating the chauvinistic and militaristic tendencies of education in the various countries has been so lukewarm that no serious efforts in this fundamentally important sphere can be hoped for from it.
Further, the spherical surface is a non-Euclidean continuum of two dimensions, that is to say, the laws of disposition for the rigid figures lying in it do not agree with those of the Euclidean plane. Further, we have or x > o and t = o, < f ( x , t) = o and [+wj(x, m must evidently t)dx = n. The problem, which accords with the problem of the diffusion outwards from a point (ignoring pos- sibilities of exchange between the diffusing par- ticles) is now mathematically completely defined (9) ; the solution is xcr The probable distribution of the resulting dis- placements in a given time t is therefore the same as that of fortuitous error, which was to be ex- pected.
Further, we imagine one of the clocks which are qualified to mark the time t when at rest relatively to the stationary system, and the time ? Further, we take the number of these movable points to be so small that we can disregard interactions between them. Further- more, he found the same kind of restless, irregular motion in very small particles of inorganic as well as organic substances. Further- more, the sphere no longer pulsates but rotates in one direction through a small angle and then back again, always in the same rhythmical way and about a definite axis. Furthermore it is clear that the asymmetry mentioned in the introduction as arising when we consider the currents produced by the relative motion of a magnet and a conductor, now disappears.
Furthermore one derives instead of equation (22) l.c., in the way as it is given there by the aid of the energy equation, the relations: /x = 0 (10) From our additional term it follows, that these equations contain no new condition in respect to (9), so that concerning the energy tensor of matter, no other presupposition has to be made than the one, that it has to be in agreement with the momentum-energy theorem. Furthermore the last of the Maxwell equations, which expresses the vanishing of the divergence of the (contravariant) electrical field density, appears to exclude in general the existence of charge densities, hence also of electrical particles.
Furthermore, a politica !instrument for securing peace by means of international negotiation in a sort of world parliament had been created in the form of the League of Nations. Furthermore, any attempt to determine the latter experimentally will alter the state of the system in such a way as to destroy the knowledge of the first. Furthermore, instead of moving the small solenoid, we could create and destroy a magnetic field by creating and destroying the current, that is, by opening and closing the circuit. Furthermore, just as the mass of an iso- lated system is unchanged even if a chemical trans- formation takes place, so heat is conserved even though it flows from one body to another. Furthermore, people living in differ?
Furthermore, people living in different countries kill each other at irregular time inter? Furthermore, selection by govemments cannot give the peoples of the world the feeling of being fairly and proportionately represented. Furthermore, technological and demographic devel? Furthermore, technological and demographic developments of the last few centuries have created conditions which are here to stay.
Furthermore, the principle of relativity teaches us that, as judged from K, the length of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest with reference to K1 must be exactly the same as the length, as judged from K', of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest relative to K. In order to see how the points of the x-axis appear as viewed from K, we only require to take a " snapshot " of K1 from K; this means that we have to insert a particular value of t (time of K), e.g. Furthermore, the theory is not restricted to gases, although its greatest successes have been in this domain.
Furthermore, the validity of the energy relation (14) certainly extends beyond wave theory; according to the theory of relativity, this transformation law also holds, e.g., for the energy density of a mass moving with (almost) the velocity of light and having infinitesimally small rest density. Furthermore, there was one consideration which reached beyond the frame of Lorentz's theory. Furthermore, this experiment, if interpreted in the old language, gives us no hint at all as to whether an induced current can be excited by the motion of another circuit carrying a current, instead of by motion of a bar magnet. Furthermore, we assume that our plate is completely reflective on both sides.
Furthermore, we can regard an atom which is emitting spectral lines as a clock, so that the following statement will hold: An atom absorbs or emits light of a frequency which is dependent on the potential of the gravitational field in which it is situated. Furthermore, we shall assume that in leaving the body each electron must perform an amount of work P characteristic of the substance. Furthermore, we shall confine ourselves to a calculation of the average value of the kinetic energy of the progressive motion, and we shall thus not attempt to prove that such velocities v obey the Maxwell distribution law.

GENER.ALISED THEORY OF RELATiVlEY 1 25 Some special cases of Particular Importance. GENERAL CONSIDERATION CINCERNING THE METHOD OF SCIENCE. GENERAL CONSIDERATION CON CERNING THE METHOD OF SCIENCE In November of 1919, the Royal Society of London announced that a scientific expedition pleted calculations that verified the predictions that Einstein had made in a paper published It has often been said, and certainly not without justification, that the man of science is a poor philosopher. GENERAL RELATIVITY AND ITS VERIFICATION The general theory of relativity attempts to formulate physical laws for all coordinate systems (c.s.). GENERAL RELATIVITY There still remains one point to be cleared up.

Galileo and Hume first upheld this principle with full clarity and decisive? Galileo and Hume first upheld this principle with full clarity and decisiveness. Galileo formulated the problem of determining the velocity of light, but did not solve it. Galileo had already moved a considerable way towards a knowledge of the law of motion. Galileo saw this clearly and wrote in his Two New Sciences : . Galileo's conclusion, the correct one, was formulated a generation later by Newton as the law of inertia. Galileo's contribution was to destroy the intuitive view and replace it by a new one.
Gauss indicated the principles according to which we can treat the geometrical relationships in the surface, and thus pointed out the way to the method of Riemman of treating multi-dimensional, non-Euclidean continuum. Gauss overcame this difficulty, in his theory of surfaces, by introducing curvilinear co-ordinates which, apart from satisfying conditions of continuity, were wholly arbitrary, and only afterwards these co-ordinates were related to the metrical properties of the surface. Gauss undertook the task of treating this two-dimensional geometry from first principles, without making use of the fact that the surface belongs to a Euclidean continuum of three dimensions. General Expressions for the Conservation Principles. General Results of the Theory.
General formulation of the field-equation of Gravitation. General relativity then formulated gravitational field laws. Generalising we must say this:There may be supposed to be extended physical objects to which the idea of motion cannot be applied. Generalizing, we must say that we can conceive cf extended physical objects to which the concept of motion cannot be applied. Generations to come, it may be, will scarce believe tbat such a one as tbis ever in flesh and blood walk.ed upon this eartb. Geometrical ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these last are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the genesis of those ideas. Geometry (G) predicates nothing about the relations of real things, but only geometry together with the purport (P) of physical laws can do so.
Geometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to give to its structure the largest possible logical unity. Geometry sets out form certain conceptions such as "plane," "point," and "straight line," with which we are able to associate more or less definite ideas, and from certain simple propositions (axioms) which, in virtue of these ideas, we are inclined to accept as "true." Geometry thus completed is evidently a natural science; we may in fact regard it as the most ancient branch of physics. Geometry, from a physical standpoint, is the totality of laws according to which rigid bodies mutually at rest can be placed with respect to each other ( e.g., a triangle consists of three rods whose ends touch permanently ).
Germany and France Mutual trust and co-operation between France and Germany can come about only if the French demand for security against military attack is satisfied. Give into the power of the teacber the fewest possible coercive measures, so that the only source of the pupil's respect for the teacber is the buman and intellectual qualities of the latter. Give into the power of the teacher the fewest possible coercive measures, so that the only source of the pupil's respect far the teacher is the human and intellectual qualities of the latter. Given all other conditions the same, that is, the same moving body and changes considered over equal time intervals, then, according to Newton, the change of velocity is proportional to the force.
Given one, however, we can find an infinite num- ber, since all c.s. Given the radiation law, the radiation friction can be calculated and, thence, the average amount of momentum the plate must receive from variations in the light-pressure to maintain a statistical equilibrium. Given this understanding, men and women will recognize that only inter- national cooperation through effective institutions can ensure security against humanity's destruction. Glass, rubber, china, and the like are insulators. God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. Good and Evil It is right in principle that those should be the best loved who have contributed most to the elevation of the human race and human life.
Gradually the conviction gained recognition that ali knowledge about things is exclusively a working-over of the raw materia! Gradually the conviction gained recognition that all knowledge about things is exclusively a working-over of the raw-material furnished by the senses. Gradually the weights fall and the clock runs down. Graphically this may be represented by two vectors, a shorter one denoting the velocity before the push and a longer one in the same direction denoting the velocity after the push. Gravitation had indeed been traced to the structure of space, but besides the gravitational field there is also the electro-magnetic field.
Gravitation is usually not taken into account because of its relative smallness; its consideration, how^ever, was always possible by means of the enrichment of the structure of the field, i.e., expan- sion of Maxwell's law of the field. Gravitation naturally does not exist for this observer. Gravitation- al forces also have this same remarkable property, and gravitation itself may be of essentially the same nature as these '^ geometrical" forces introduced by a change of axes. Gravitational Theory of Relativity thus brings out clearly the funda- mental distinction between actual physical space-time (which is non-isotropie and non-Euclid-Newtonian) on one hand and the abstract Euclid-Newtonian continuum (which is homogeneous, isotropic and a purely intellectual construc- tion) on the other.
Gravitational force, which causes the cart to stay on the plane, does not change, and plays no role in the determination of the mass. Great importance attaches to the materia! Great importance attaches to the material comforts of life, and peace, freedom from care, security are all sacrificed to them. Greeting to G. Bernard Shaw There are few enough people with sufficient independence to see the weaknesses and follies of their contemporaries and remain themselves untouched by them. Guided by empirical data, the investigator rather develops a system of thought which, in general, is built up logically from a small number of fundamental assumptions, the so-called axioms.
Guided by purely formal points of view, H. A. Lorentz was the first to introduce the hypothesis that the form of the electron experiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of that motion. Guided by the mechanical point of view we realize that there is still one question to be answered : the determination of the mechanical properties of the ether. Guided by this example, we see that our extension of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass.

H and E are energy values of the same body referred to two systems of co-ordinates which are in motion relatively to each other, the body being at rest in one of the two systems (system (x,y,z)). H any deduction from it should prove untenable, it must be given up. H on the other hand every citizen realizes that the only guarantee for security and peace in this atomic age is the constant development of a supranational government, then he will do everything in his power to strengthen the United Na? H this con- cept 1.s correct, then the sum mgh + m "v22 must have the same value for any position of the pendulum, if h is understood to represent the height above C, and v the velocity at that point in the pendulum's path.
H you bave followed attentively my meditations up to this point, you will probably wonder about one thing. H. A. LORENTZ'S WORK IN THE CAUSE OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION Written in 1927. H. A.

Lorentz accepted these weaknesses of bis theory, which were well known to him, in order to explain the phenomena cor? H. A. Lorentz even discovered the "Lorentz transfarmation," later called after him, though without recognizing its group character. H. A. Lorentz knew this very well. H. A. Lorentz"^ has found out the " Relativity theorem'' and has created the Relativitj^-postulate as a hypothesis that electrons and matter suffer contractions in consequence of their motion according to a certain law.
H. A. Lorentz's work in the cause of International Co-operation With the extensive specialization of scientific research which the nineteenth century brought about, it has become rare for a man occupying a leading position in one of the sciences to manage at the same time to do valuable service to the community in the sphere of international organization and international. H. A. Lorentz, a Dutch theoretical physi? H. A. Wilson repeated the experiment in an improved form in 1903 and working with ebonite found that the observed effect was pro- portional to K 1 instead of to K. For gases K is nearly equal to 1 and hence practically no effect will be observed in their case. H. It means the velocity of the light wave, of course. H. That is not a convincing argument.
H. Weyl, it seems, has developed a geometrical theory (in hyper-space) in which no fundamental distinction is made between gravitational and electrical forces. H. Yes, that is a difficulty, although not a new one to me. HE previous considerations concerning the configuration of rigid bodies have been founded, T irrespective of the assumption as to the validity of the Euclidean geometry, upon the hypothesis that all directions in space, or all configurations of Cartesian systems of co-ordinates, are physically equivalent. HE theory of relativity is intimately connected with the theory of space and time.

HERE I sit in order to write, at the age of sixty- seven, something like my own obituary. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION XV Maxwell-Lorentz system of field equations.

HUMAN RIGHTS Address to Chicago Decalogue Society, February 20, 1954. Had we chosen the second as our unit of time, we would have obtained E0 = mc2 (44) Mass and energy are therefore essentially alike; they are only different expressions for the same thing. Had we introduced, instead of AP" , the covariant tensor Apo- = g pago-13 A..f>, which is also symmetrical, the last term, by virtue of (31), would assume the form -CJ gP" g, Apua vx,,.

Has not every one of us struggled for words although the connection between "things" was already clear? Has not everyone of us struggled for words although the connection between "things" was already clear? Have we any right to hope that experiencewill guideus aright,when thereare theories(like classical mechanics)which agree with experienceto a very great extent, even without comprehendingthe subjectin its depths? Have you ever tested the civil courage of your countrymen? Having considered this possibility very carefully I feel that it is more desirable to accept the lack of internal uni? Having myself given so much thought to this subject I feel that it is right that I should give you my perfectly frank opinion on them.
Having reached this point we have still to seek a theory for those parts of space in which the electricaldensity does not vanish. Having regard to (20), there follows from the field equations (7) of gravita.tion, by multiplication by rt; and summation with respect to and v, -()t + lx., , ,l9.R - igrr ()g v - O, J or, in view of (19) and (21), <>:t; i v _ O "lg<T -'V v - 173 (22) nX v where :t,.v denotes the quantities gva-:t;. Having seen in the foregoing that the generai postulate of relativity leads to the requirement that the equations of physics shall be covariant in the face of any substitution of the co-ordinates x 1 x4, we have to consider how such a generally covariant equations can be found.
Having succeeded so far, they are now proceeding to suppress the freedom of teaching and to deprive of their positions ali those who do not prove submissive, i.e., to starve them. He achieved this advance in the science of electricity, the most important since Clerk Maxwell, by divesting the ether of its me- chanical, and matter of its electro-magnetic proper- ties. He achieved this, the most important advance in the theory of electricity since Maxwell, by taking from ether its mechanical, and from matter its electromagnetic qualities. He also felt uneasy about the introduction of action at a distance.
He also had the pleasure of inspiring his own son to become his intelligent and independent fellow-worker, and of exciting the warm interest and co-operation of Sauerbruch just in the last years of his life, so that he was able to die with the consoling thought that his life's work would not perish, but would be vigorously continued on the lines he had laid down. He also set great store by the treatment of peritonitis by an anti-toxic coli-serum which he discovered, and rejoiced in the successes he achieved with it. He also showed that the Lor- entz-transformation (apart from a different algebraic sign due to the special character of time) is nothing but a rotation of the coordinate sys- tem in the four-dimensional space.
He and other right-minded men succeeded, after repeated efforts, in securing the removal of the offensive exclusion-clause from the statutes of the "Conseil." He asked himself bow tbe discrete states could be understood by the aid of the current concepts, and bit on a parallel with stationary waves, as far instance in the case of the proper frequencies of organ pipes and strings in acoustics. He asks : " How does it come that certain reference-bodies (or their states of motion) are given priority over other reference-bodies (or their states of motion) ? He bas only been given bis big brain by mis? He based his investigations with unfaltering consistency upon the following hypotheses: The seat of the electromagnetic feld is the empty space.
He becomes a sort of hot-house plant and, when his body is cured, often finds it difficult to get back to normal life. He becomes a sort of hot-house plant and, when his body is cured, often finds it difficult to get back to normal life_ This is in particular true far university students. He believed that he was here on the track of a general biological principle of widest application, whose implications he followed out with admirable boldness and persistence. He brought theory into harmony with experience by means of a wonderful simplification of theoretical principles. He can find a brigbt side to any situation. He can find a bright side to any situation.
He cannot proceed without considering critically a much more difficult problem, the problem of analyzing the nature of everyday thinking. He cannot therefore do otherwise than define time in such a way that the rate of going of a clock depends on its position. He conceived these fields as states of mechanical stress in a space-filling medium, similar to the states of stress in an elastically distended body. He considers hiillself obliged as a matter of course to place a large portion of his wealth, and often of his own energies, tao, at the disposal of the community; public opinion, that all-powerful farce, imperiously demands it of him.
He considers himself obliged as a matter of course to place a large portion of his wealth, and often of his own energies too, at the disposal of the community, and public opinion, that all-powerful force, imperiously demands it of him. He considers time itself to be one of the co-ordinate axes, and in his four- dimensional world, that is in the space-time reality, relative motion is reduced to a rotation of the axes of reference. He decides to apply his discovery to the construction of a switchback, and must find out for himself how to build one. He declares that the Soviet Union cannot accept this thesis.
He dis- covered the law of inertia and the law of bodies falling freely in the gravitational field of the earth, namely, that a mass (more accurately, a mass-point) which is unaffected by other masses moves uniformly and in a straight line. He dramatizes impossible extremes in an amateurish manner. He ex- periences the same sensation as anyone in a train or car travelling fast round a curve, or even more, on a rotating merry-go-round. He feels the individual destiny as an imprisonment and seeks to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance. He finds that no forces inside the lift act upon the two bodies, and so they are at rest, just as if they were in an inertial c.s.
He finds the splitting of the four-dimensional world-continua into space and time natural and convenient. He found this remarkably easy, as he possessed an uncommonly strong spatial imagination and a remarkably sure feeling for mechanism. He had realized that observable geometrical magnitudes (distances of material points from one another) and their course in time do not completely characterize motion in its physical aspects. He has drummed into us that society is responsible for the fate of every individua! He has drummed it into us that society is responsible for the fate of every individual and shown us a way to translate the consequent obligation of the community into fact. He has no use far the religion of fear and equally little far socia!
He has no use for the religion of fear and equally little for social or moral religion. He has not succeeded in building the kind of sys? He has often told me of the fights he had in pursuing this object, the difficulties of which he once described to me in the following riddle: Question : What is a scientific author? He has only been given his big brain by mistake; a backbone was all he needed. He has predicted a shift of spectral lines towards the red, due to an intense gravitational potential. He himself feels a strange force pushing him against the wall. He introduced new variables for the raoving system defined by the following set of equations.
He is an advocate of enduring peace, and has spoken against the threat of a new war, and against the ambition of the militarists to bring American science completely under their control. He is associated with a number of public organizations. He is aware that space must possess a kind of physical reality if his laws of motion are to have any meaning, a reality of the same sort as material points and the intervals between them. He is completely dependent on :ENSURING THE FUTURE OF MANKIND 65 the prejudices and fashions of his times, since he never gets to see or hear anything else. He is devoted to bis family and lays everything be possesses at his wife's feet. He is devoted to his family and lays everything he possesses at his wife's feet.
He is friendly, confident, optimistic, and without envy. He is friendly, self.confident, optimistic-and without envy. He is in just the same plight as the historian, who also, even though unconsciously, disposes events of the past around ideals that he has formed about human society. He is pragmatic, in insisting that the Editor's Note: There is probably no modern School in Zurich, he was at first unable to find only test of concepts is their usefulness in de a teaching post, working instead as a technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office from 1901 until 1908. He is satisfied if he can deduce his theorems from axioms correctly, that is, without errors of logic. He is so complete!y a slave to his job that he has no time for the con?
He is so completely a slave to his job that he has no time for the considerations of any non-personal subject or for any mental activity outside it. He is the comforter in unhappiness and in unsatisfied longing, the protector of the souls of the dead. He is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a room of a home on our earth. He is unquestionably one of the greatest discoverers of our age in the scientific field. He knew that a scientific book, even though popular, must not be read in the same way as a novel. He knows, of course, that many admirable sons of the Jewish people have made important contributions to the glory of European civilization; but have they not all, with a few exceptions, done much the same as he?
He leaves the question to the philosopher. He logical unity brings us to a tertiary sys may, it is true, propose any word as the tem, still poorer in concepts and rela tions, for the deduction of the concepts solution ; but, there is only one word and relations of the secondary (and so which really solves the puzzle in all its indirectly of the primary) layer. He looks upon individual existence as a sort of prison and wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole. He makes this cosmos and its construction the pivot of his emotional life, in order to find in this way the peace and security which he cannot find in the narrow whirlpool of personal experience. He may also believe in the existence of the ideal limit of knowledge and that it is approached by the human mind.
He may be a very cultured person, but he will probably put wine into the bottles, use the flannel for cleaning, and never once entertain the idea of doing the things we have described. He may call this ideal limit the objective truth. He may even intellectually or mathematically conceive of a third dimension, but he can not visualize it. He may, it is true, propose any word as the solution; but, there is only one word which really solves the puzzle in all its forms. He meant more to me personally than any? He might also interpret his experience thus: " My body of reference (the carriage) remains permanently at rest. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beau tiful and of the morally good.
He must fasten himself with strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest impact against the floor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room. He must first discover his principles and then draw the conclusions which follow from them. He must have the courage to set an example by word and deed, and must watch lest his children become influenced by this racial bias. He must in the most uncompromising fashion support disarmament all round, which is actually envisaged in the unfortunate Treaty of Versailles; unless military and aggressively patriotic education is abolished, we can hope for no progress.
He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings in arder to acquire a proper relationship to individuai fellow-men and to tbe com? He must not be the judge in his own case, but wait for the judgment of impartial outsiders. He must serve the cause by all means in his power. He must therefore take up this pressure by means of his legs if he does not wish to be laid out full length on the floor. He need only consider that planetary courses within the solar system may be calculated in advance with great exactitude on the basis of a limited number of simple laws. He need only consider tliat planetary courses witliin tlie solar system may be calculated in advance witli great exactitude on tlie basis of a limited number of simple laws.
He never became the typical conscientious North German, whom the Italians in the days of their freedom used to call bestia seriosa. He noticed that the time required for the fall was always the same, that the motion of a falling body does not depend on the mass. He notices that the motion becomes more uniform as the table and the spheres are made smoother. He often told me of the battles he had to fight in pursuing this objective, describing his diflculties to me in the following riddle: Question: What is a scientific author? He proved this in the famous experi- ment with the rotating vessel of water. He pushes small spheres along a horizontal table, trying to eliminate friction so far as possible. He rather has the feeling of a child, over whom a grown-up person rules.
He realized that in order to understand any page he must have read the preceding ones carefully. He realized that it was possible to preserve hypothesis (1) without introducing the less natural cosmological term into the field equations of gravitation, if one was ready to drop hypothesis (2). He realized that the existing popular periodi? He reports : By these experiments it seems to be shown that the mag- netic needle was moved from its position by help of a galvanic apparatus, and that, when the galvanic circuit was closed, but not when open, as certain very celebrated physicists in vain attempted several years ago. He reports further : While examining the form of these particles immersed in water, I observed many of them evidently in motion ....
He sees the face and the moving hands, even hears its tick- ing, but he has no way of opening the case. He shaped his life like an exquisite work of art down to the smallest detail. He showed ^hat the whole of what was then known about light and electro-magnetic phenomena was expressed in his well known double system of differential equations, in which the electric and the magnetic fields appear as the dependent variables. He showed how such a viscous ether would explain aberration if all motion in it were differentially irrotational. He soon dis- covers by trial and error that he must follow a very simple rule: he may build his track in whatever path he pleases so long as no point is higher than the starting- point. He speaks over the radio and writes in the press.
He spoils bis wife unbelievably and is utterly under her thumb. He spoils his wife unbelievably and is utterly under her thumb. He succeeded in securing wonderful results bearing on the factors which favour the growth of epithelium at the expense of that of connective tissue, results which may well be of decisive importance for the study of cancer. He summarized the results of many trials as follows : i st. That the quantity of heat produced by the friction of bodies, whether solid or liquid, is always proportional to the quantity of force expended. He this concept of the bodily object a sig nificance, which is to a high degree inde pendent of the sense impressions which originally give rise to it.
He took the conception of force from the science of statics which had already reached a high stage of development. He tried to describe the action of two elec- tric charges only by concepts referring directly to the two charges. He tried to retain as long as possible his belief that he would succeed in explaining all events in nature by these fundamental concepts of reality. He was also not quite comfortable about the introduction of forces operating at a distance. He was extremely conscientious without allowing anything to assume undue importance; a subtle bumor guarded him, which was reflected in bis eyes and in his smile. He was justified in sticking to his corpuscular theory of light. He was one of the few outstanding personalities who embody the conscience of a generation.
He was sensitive as a youth to the tonic beauty of the lakes and woods of Brandenburg, and as he sailed the boat with an expert hand through these beloved and familiar surroundings he opened the secret treasure-chamber of his heart to me he spoke of his experiments, scientific ideas, and ambitions. He who has looked into this little world sees our actual world in a new light; its puppets insinuate themselves into real people, making them suddenly look quite different. He who knows it not and can no longer wonder, no longer feel amazement, is as good as dead, a snuffed-out candle. He will also see how the latter are deduced from each other. He will discover how the words point, straight-line, plane are used in the propositions.
He will even be able to frame new propositions according to the known rules. He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison. He would have confined himself to blushing for his countrymen. Heat is, according to our view, a substance, such as mass in mechanics. Heat must be mechanical energy if every problem is a mechanical one. Heating, melting, vaporization, or combining into chemical compounds would not change the total mass. Heinrich Hertz took no steps towards mitigating this dualism. Help to make these efforts a real success. Hence Euclidean geometry does not apply o K'.
Hence I most seriously believe that one does people the best service by giving them some elevating work to do and thus indirectly elevating them. Hence I should like to commend someone who has this gift of explanation, Emery Reves, whose book, The Anatomy of the Peace, is intelligent, clear, brief, and, if I may use the abused term, dynamic on the topic of war and need for world govemment. Hence Lorentz's efforts resemble those of a doctor with a recalcitrant patient who refuses to take the medicines carefully prepared for his benefit. Hence equations (1) and (2) become e curl H= ?i^ -I // div D + curl Veet. Hence even today primitive man lives in constant fear that supematural and arbitrary forces will intervene in his destiny.
Hence if one admitted singularities as representing particles one would have here a case of two particles not accelerated by their gravitational interaction, which would certainly be excluded physically. Hence in such a gravi- tational field the vertical acceleration of a mechanical system or of its center of gravity works out inde- pendently of its internal kinetic energy. Hence in the case depicted in fig. Hence in the course of the erosion an advance of the wave-line of the meander-formation is bound to take place in the direction of the cur- rent. Hence it appears that the energij depends upon the system of reference.
Hence it cannot be contended that the man in walking travels the distance w relative to the railway line in a time which is equal to one second as judged from the embankment. Hence it comes about that it is not necessary to introduce definite assumptions as to the physical nature of matter (in the narrower sense). Hence it follows that classical mechanics is in accord with the principle of special relativity if the two hypotheses respecting scales and clocks are made. Hence it follows that the right side of (13) must always vanish if all A x " vanish. Hence it immediately follows that A = (24) "' lx,,, is a covariant four-vector-the "gradient " of cp.
Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with the highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as Atheists, sometimes also as saints. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. Hence it satisfies the conditions of the special theory of relativity; but looked at from the standpoint of the latter, it takes on a new aspect. Hence it was inevitable t11at the activity of the individual inves?
Hence it was inevitable that the activity of the individual investigator should be confined to a smaller and smaller section of human knowledge. Hence it was to be expected that those fields of farce would also influence De Broglie's wave fields in an analogous way. Hence light path velocity = time interval where time interval is to be taken in the sense of the definition in 1. Hence science has been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. Hence that pathetic creature, the baptized Jewish Geheimrat of yesterday and to-day. Hence the Generalised Principle of Relativity asserts that " absolute " motion cannot be detected even with the help of gravitational laws.
Hence the Principle of Relativity (so far as it is applied to ohenomena other than electromagnetic) must be resrarded as ^ pn.^tHlafe, which we have assumed to be true, but for which we cannot adduce any definite proof, until after the generalisation is made and its consequences tested in the light of actual experience. Hence the attempt to alter the mechanical equations in such a way that the inertia of bodies is traced back to relative motion on their part not as against absolute space but as against the totality of other ponderable bodies. Hence the electromagnetic effect near the moving dielectric would be proportional to the total electric displacement, that is to K, the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric.
Hence the existence of such a bridge between the two shells in the finite realm corre? Hence the idea of a straight line also loses its meaning. Hence the imperfections of the construction of squares in the previous section do not show themselves clearly until this construction is extended over a considerable portion of the surface of the table. Hence the intensity of the field at the surface would ultimately become infinite with increasing radius R of the sphere, which is impossible. Hence the man of good will is never happier than when some communal enterprise is afoot and is launched at the cost of heavy sacrifices, with the single object of promoting life and culture.
Hence the man of good wll is never happier than when some communal enterprise is afoot and is launched at the cost of heavy sacrifces, with the single object of promoting if e and culture. Hence the moral danger of the Jew who has lost touch with his own people and is regarded as a foreigner by the people of his adoption. Hence the most important cultural functions can be lef t to private enterprise and the part played by the government in this country is, comparatively, a very restricted one. Hence the most important cultural functions can be left to private enterprise, and the part played by the State in this country is, comparatively, a very restricted one. Hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than he will see that emitted from A.
Hence the pressure at A is greater than at B, and the cylinder is acted upon by a force from left to right, which is made use of to propel the ship. Hence the pressure will be the same at A and B and there is no dynamic effect on the cylinder. Hence the proposition follows at once. Hence the task that confronts our age is certainly no easier than the tasks our immediate predecessors successfully performed. Hence the velocity of light with respect to the plat- form is 21/ ^ c/^, a variable quantity depending on the " absolute " velocity of the platform. Hence there are those who would in al!seriousness forbid the introduction of technical improvements. Hence there are those who would in all seriousness forbid the introduction of technical improvements.
Hence w^e see how pit i/sical space and time is aetuallv defined bv the local distribution of matter. Hence we can prove nearly all the laws which apply to the te.nsor of the second rank defined by (9) in the simplest manner by demonstrating them for the special tensors of the type (8). Hence we conclude that W>c is an impossibility, there can be no velocity greater than that of light. Hence we may hope that the fight against war will find strong support among Americans. Hence we may look upon these co-ordinate differa entials as the components of a " tensor " of the particular kind which we cali a contravariant four-vector. Hence we o \; must add this term to a purely temporal rate of change -r^ . Hence with W>c, we can always make t' , the time from A to B in equation (1) " negative."
Hence, the hitherto prevailing transformation equations in passing from one frame to another moving relative to it rest on arbitrary assumptions. Hence, there will be a net force that opposes the motion of the plate, and increases with the speed of the plate. Hence, when applying the same approximation, equation (6) furnishes . Henceforth, the old conception of space for itself, and time for itself shall reduce to a mere shadow, and some sort of union of the two will be found consistent with facts. Her strength, her purity of will, her austerity toward herself, her objectivity, her incorruptible judgment- all these were of a kind seldom found joined in a single individual. Here "equal" means having the same absolute value; + 5 and 5, for example, have the same absolute value.
Here (X0, Y0, Z0) and (L0, M0, N0) are the vectors defining the amplitude of the wave-train, and l,m,n the direction-cosines of the wave-normals. Here H. A. Lorentz found an escape which showed, at the same time, the way to an electrodynamic theory of bodies in motion, a theory which was more or less free of arbitrary assumption. Here I am using a method of calei'ilation, which enables us to deal in a simple manner with the space-time vectors of the 1st, and 2ud kind, and of which the rules, as far as required are given below. Here P(x&) are to be regarded merely as the coefficients of the expansion of + into a series of orthogonal functions u(x)). Here T11 denotes the energy-tensor of the electro-magnetic field, arising from the electrical particles constituting matter.
Here again is a problem for the solution of which new principles are needed. Here again is the old, much discussed, problem of deter- mining the velocity in one c.s. Here again that familiar name ! Here again the attempt to construct particles out of the field theory, leads apparently to singularities. Here again we must distinguish between the motion of the wave and the motion of the separate plants, which undergo only small oscillations. Here again, idealized experiments will be discussed. Here all the fruitless attempts to construct an ether in some simple way, as well as the other objections, seem to indicate that the fault lies in the fundamental assump- tion that it is possible to explain all events in nature from a mechanical point of view.
Here also the coordination of the 'ljJ function to an ensemble of systems eliminates every di:fficulty.4 4 The operation of measuring A, for example, thus involves a transition to a narrower ensemble of systems. Here also the ende.avor has been made to overcome this defect by the intro? Here also the velocity c plays the part of an unattainable limiting velocity. Here for the first time geometrical figures appear, up to a point, as parts of infinite space, which is conceived as a three-dimensional continuum. Here for the first time the partial differential equation appeared as the natural expression of the primary- realities of physics.
Here for the first time the world witnessed the miracle of a logical system which pro- ceeded from step to step with such precision that every single one of its propositions was absolutely indubitable I refer to Euclid's geometry. Here from the very first there can be no doubt that the settlement of this question is in some way connected w^ith the simplest forms which can be given to the fundamental equations, satisfying the conditions of covarianee. Here is Newton's explanation of this phenomenon: every colour is already present in white light. Here is a "timetable" describing the positions of the stone after 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 seconds.
Here is a description of one of Newton's experiments in his own words : In the year 1666 (at which time I applied myself to the grinding of optick glasses of other figures than spherical) I procured me a triangular glass prism, to try therewith the celebrated phenomena of colours. Here is a different state of affairs from classical mechanics, where absolute uniform motion is quite meaningless because of Galileo's law of inertia. Here is no systematic course in elementary physical facts and theories. Here is the eternal antithesis of the two inseparable constituents of human knowledge, Experience and Reason, within the sphere of physics. Here is the first instance in which the relativity theory and classical physics differ radically.
Here is yet another application of the principle of relativity for the delec- tation of the reader : Today I am described in Ger- many as a German savant/' and in England as a Swiss Jew." Here it moves freely, spreading over the whole metal including the gold leaves. Here it was not only the behaviour of a tiny magnetic needle which broke the apparently well-founded and successful me- chanical theories. Here knowledge of truth alone does not su:ffice; on the contrary this knowledge must continually be renewed by ceaseless eff ort, if it is not to be lost. Here knowledge of truth alone does not suffice; on the contrary this knowledge must continually be renewed by cease? Here m has obviously the significance of a gravitating mass, e that of an electrical charge.
Here one has an immense advantage over everybody else, and one ought not to leave the op- portunity unused out of modesty. Here our spheres must be called "rigid" spheres. Here our spheres must be called rigid spheres. Here stands in the same relation to @ as {')* to ). Here the Gaussian coordinates are samply Cartesian ones. Here the concep "simultaneous" was assumed as physically meaningful without special definition. Here the contraction of moving bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without the introduction of particular hypotheses ; and as the prime factor involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in itself, to which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to the body of reference chosen in the particular case in point.
Here the following method suggests itself. Here the sceptic may remark that he sees no ad- vantage in the introduction of vectors. Here the statistical laws are given immedi- ately. Here there are the greatest differences and they are of great? Here there are the greatest differences and they are of greatest impor? Here there is no method capable of being learned and systematically applied so that it leads to the goal. Here too circumstances require an intemational solution, with the psychological foundation for such a solu? Here too the observed fact is undoubtedly the supreme arbiter; but it cannot pronounce sen- vcnce until the wide chasm separating the axioms from their verifiable consequences has been bridged by much intense, hard thinking.
Here too we are in the midst of a struggle whose issue will decide the fate of all of us. Here we again a.pply the method * It is only between the second (and frst) derivatives that, by 12, the relations BP = O subsist. Here we bave to take into consideration that the energy-tensor of "matter " is almost exclusively defined by the density of matter in the narrower sense, i.e. Here we can describe two entirely different things. Here we could once more ask: "What is an inertial c.s.?" Here we face, therefore, the limits of the purely rational con? Here we face, therefore, the limits of the purely rational conception of our existence. Here we find in the history of science one of the very few instances in which accident seemed to play an essential role.
Here we have The right side of (82) as well as L is an invariant in a Lorentz transformation^ and the 4x4 element on the 48 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY right side of (83) as well as Ski, represent a space time vector of the second kind. Here we have for a period of the clock ^9= 1, d.r^=^di\=^d. Here we have many clocks in each c.s. Here we must mention particularly the five-dimensional theory of Kaluza and Klein. Here we shall simply adopt the following mode of expression. Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle in one point, which N though by no means evi- dent N could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt appeared to be out of the question.
Here, cp denotes the angle between the X-axis and a randomly chosen 1 ON IHE QUANTUM THEORY OF RADIATION 75 direction. Here, for a change, we shall have a falling lift. Here, however, the sum does not remain constant, but grows smaller. Here, however, there are, and the velocity changes not in magnitude but in direction. Here, however, this equality reflected in the equal acceleration of all falling bodies is essential and forms the basis of our whole argument. Here, however, we are concerned with an objective which cannot be reached step by step. Here, in this most classical problem, we recognize the familiar features of the quantum theory. Here, it seems to me, lie the roots of the controversy carried on some years ago between Mach and Planck.
Here, m the field theory of generai relativity, we meet the same problem of a theoretical field-representation of matter as was met originally in connection with the pure Maxwell theory. Here, since the days of the Prophets, one of the fairest fields of activity has lain open to our nation, scattered as it is over the earth and united only by a common tradition. Here, too, we must supplement the differential equations by limiting conditions at spatial infinity, if we really bave to regard the universe as being of infinite spatial extent. Herein we find the hydrodynamic theory, and the theory of elasticity of solid bodies. Heroism by order, senseless violence, and all the pestilent nonsense that does by the name of patriotism how I hate them! Heroism on command, senseless violence, and al!
Herr Planck has derived2 the condition for the dynamics equilibrium in this case under the supposition that the radiation can be considered a completely random process.3 He found (E?) Hertz had found the simplest fonn of the equations of the electro? Hertz's electrodynamics of moving bodies rests entirely upon this fundamental attitude. Hertz's re- searches on dectric waves, first carried out in 1886, succeeded in furnishing a strong experimental conlh-mation HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION II of Maxwell's theory.
Hertzs theory not only suffered from the defect that it attributed to matter and the ether mechanical and electrical properties, with no rational connection between them; it was a^so inconsistent with the result of Fizeaus famous experiment on the velocity of the propagation of light in a liquid in motion and other well authenticated empirical facts. His clear and wide ideas will for ever retain their significance as the foundation on which our modem conceptions of physics have been built. His d iscoveries prepared the ground for many of the mod em d evelopments in physics, most par? His efforts were especially directed toward the re-establishment of fruitful and friendly cooperation between men of learning and scientific societies.

His genius and Nature, benevolent in this case, gave it to him. His genius led the way from Maxwell's work to the achievements of con? His genius was the torch which lighted the way from the teachings of Clerk Maxwell to the achievements of contemporary physics, to the fabric of which he contributed valuable materials and methods.
His great and lucid ideas will retain their unique significance for all time as the foundation of our whole modern conceptual structure in the sphere of natural philosophy. His is no idle daydreaming, but a search for the logically simplest possibilities and their consequences. His life was ordered like a work of art down to the smallest detail.

His never-failing kindness and magnanimity and his sense of justice, coupled with an intuitive understanding of people and things, made him a leader in any sphere he entered.
His object in taking this step, which caused great offence to the academic world of the Central Powers, was to influence this institution in such a way that it could be expanded into something truly international. His object in taking this step, which caused great offense to the academic world of the Centrai Powers, was to influence this institution in such a way that it could be ex? His quite unusual !ad of human frailties never had a depressing effect on others. His reasoning would run something like this: u The substance theory can explain the apparent creation of heat.
His religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant refiection.

His task might comprise the following, a) to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried out ried on within the limits of the budgets of the University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds are required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the neotwy equioaent. His theory was built on the following fundamen?
His theory, formulated twenty-five years ago, draws a pic- ture of the atom from which, at any rate in simple cases, the spectra of the elements can be calculated and the apparently dull and unrelated numbers are suddenly made coherent in the light of the theory. His universe will be two- dimensional. His very acbievement bas already conferred a higber boon upon him. His work and his example will live on as an inspiration and a blessing to many generations. His work and his example will live on as an inspiration and guide to future generations. His work covered many field s of physics, but his most outstand ing contributions were to the theory of electromagnetism in ali its ramifications. His work thus falls into two parts.
History brought in its verdict, in favour of the wave theory of light and against the corpuscular theory, at a much later date, the middle of the nineteenth century. History has given us a difficult row to hoe; but so long as we remain devoted servants of truth, justice, and liberty, we shall continue not merely to survive as the oldest of living peoples, but by creative work to bring forth fruits which contribute to the ennoblement of the human race, as heretofore. History has set us a great and noble task in the shape of active cooperation in the building up of Palestine. Hitherto I have purposely refrained from speaking about the physical interpretation of space- and time-data in the case of the general theory of relativity.
Hitherto it had been silently assumed that the four-dimensional con- tinuum of events could be split up into time and space in an objective manner i.e., that an absolute significance attached to the *now in the world of events. Hitherto tbis commisson has met twce a year. Hitherto this Commission has met twice a year. Hitler is living or shall I say sitting? Hitler is no more representative of the Germany of this decade than are the smaller anti-Semitic disturbances. Hitler will sink into oblivion. Ho observed a change proportional toK 1 and not to K, Thus the above set of electro-n)agnetic experiments contradict the Mertz-Hcaviside equations, and these must be abandoned. Homogeneous light passing through the two holes gives light and dark stripes on the screen.
Hoping that my request will not fall on deaf ears, I am, etc. Horrible weapons have been invented, capable of destroying in a few seconds huge masses of human beings and tremendous areas of territory. How Newton, starting from Keplers laws of planetary motion, per- formed this task for gravitation and so discovered that the kinetic forces acting on the stars and gravity were of the same nature, is well known. How are our customary ideas of space and time related to the character of our experiences? How are the various forms of matter built from them? How are these facts to be explained? How are we to find the place and time of an event in relation to the train, when we know the place and time of the event with respect to the railway embankment ?
How are we to measure this stick during motion? How are we to poceed from th1s pomt m order to obtain a complete theory of atomi? How can a moving corpuscle have anything to do with a wave? How can cosmic religious feeling be communicated from one person to another, if it can give rise to no definite notion of a God and no theology? How can experience furnish an answer? How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality? How can it conceive of a God, before whom a thousand years and a thousand dimensions are as one? How can one help people who rest satisfied with a statement like that? How can one save Europe from a new disaster? How can the first term be explained?
How can the rights of the individua!be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured? How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?Clarity about the aims and problems of socialism is of greatest significance in our age of transition. How can this cosmic religious experience be communicated from man to man, if it cannot lead to a definite conception of God or to a theology? How can this fact be explained mechanically? How can tls be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him? How can we describe interaction between elementary quanta of matter and field?
How can we hope to choose the latter in such a manner as to justify us in expecting success as a consequence? How can we make sure that distant clocks always show exactly the same time? How could an electron passing through a hole possibly know that another hole has been made some distance away? How could unity in our con- ception of natural forces be saved? How different it is todayl In the lightning flashes of our tempestuous times one sees human beings and things in their nakedness. How difficult it would be to find those facts without the concept of field ! How do concepts and judg- ments depend on each other? How do these particles interact with the field? How do we really determine mass in practice?
How does it come about that alongside of the idea of ponderable matter, which is derived by abstraction from everyday life, the physicists set the idea of the existence of another kind of matter, the ether? How does society fare, how the individual? How does the attraction or repulsion depend on the distance between the poles? How doubly great, therefore, is the moral danger of the Jew who has lost his kinship with his own group and whom the people of the nation in which he lives regard as an alien!
How great must his faith in a uniform law have been, to have given him the strength to devote ten years of hard and patient work to the empirical investigation of the movement of the planets and the mathematical laws of that move- ment, entirely on his own, supported by no one and understood by very few! How happy he was when he had succeeded in making somebody fit for normal life by putting right the muscular system of his face, foot, or arm! How he found time and energy for them was always a mystery to me; but the passion for scientific enquiry is not to be crushed by any burdens. How is it possible that the presence of the other hole completely changes the effect?
How is it possible that, from the results of Oersted's and Faraday's experiments, we can form a new type of law, which proves so important for the further development of physics? How is it possible then that the presence of another pinhole completely changes the effect? How is it possible to understand this phenomenon by the help of the quantum theory of light, disregarding the wave theory? How is it, that scientific language is international? How is this axiom to be interpreted in the older sense and in the more modern sense? How is this effect to be understood from the point of view of the quantum theory of light? How is this motion to be explained? How long shall we tolerate that politicians, hungry for power, try to gain politica!
How much misery does this fact cause mankindl lt is the source of wars and every kind of oppression, which fili the earth with pain, sighs, and bitterness. How strange is the lot of us mortalsl Eacb of us is bere far a brief sojourn; far what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks be senses it. How strongly developed this sense of the sanctity of life is in the Jewish people is admirably illustrated by a little remark which Walter Rathenau once made to me in conversation: "When a Jew says that he's going hunting to amuse himself, he lies." How thankful he was, with his hands tied as they were by his duties, to have found such an admirable and infinitely enthusiastic fellow-worker in FrSlein Knake! How then can we measure the wave-lengths of these rays?
How this is to be understood I will explain immediately. How this is to be understood will forthwith be expounded. How true this is, only they can judge who have seen it with their own eyes. How was each single iron filing among a Iot scattered on a piece of paper to know of the single electric particles running round in a nearby cond':1ctor? How was unity to be preserved in his comprehension of the forces of nature? How, then, could such a universal principle be found? However deeply I may regret the things that are being done there, however strongly I am bound to condemn the terrible mistakes that are being made with the approval of the Government; it is impossible for me to take part personally in an enterprise set on foot by responsible members of a foreign Government.
However many times the experiment is repeated, the final velocity is always the same. However much our political convictions may differ, I know that we agree on one point: in the progressive achievements of the European mind both of us see and love our highest good. However much the Jews adapted themselves, in language, manners, and to a great extent even in the forms of religion, to the European peoples among whom they lived, the feeling of strangeness between the Jews and their hosts never disappeared. However strong national armaments may be, they do not create mili? However understandable this desire far isolation may be, it remains no less disastrous to Russia and to all other nations; I shall say more about it later on.
However, I do not believe that quantum mechanics will be the starting point in the search for this basis, just as, vice versa, one could not go from thermodynamics (resp. However, I worked most of the time in the physical laboratory, fascinated by the direct contact with experience. However, Max- well's equations did not permit the derivations of the equilibrium of the electricity which constitutes a par- ticle. However, Russell's just cited remark uncovers a con?
However, Russell's just cited remark uncovers a connection: If Berkeley relies upon the fact that we do not directly grasp the "things" of the external world through our senses, but that only events causally connected with the presence of "things" reach our sense-organs, then this is a consideration which gets its persuasive character from our confidence in the physical mode of thought. However, Y1it11the affairs of active human beings it is differ? However, all scient:ifc statements and laws have one characteristic in common: they are "true or false" (adequate or inadequate ). However, already in the 'twenties, the Russian mathematician Friedman showed that a different hypothesis was natural from a purely theoretical point of view.
However, ethical directives can be made rational and coherent by logical thinking and empirical knowledge. However, even if, of all the conceivable Lorentz-invariant laws, one had accidentally guessed precise- ly the law which belongs to the wider group, one would still not be on the plane of insight achieved by the general principle of relativity. However, every effort is being made to avoid this, since almost every import would make a part of the produc? However, except for a very small number of anarchists, everyone of us is convinced that civilized society cannot exist without a gov?
However, in chemistry only the ratios of the atomic masses played any role, not their absolute magnitudes, so that atomic theory could be viewed more as a visual- izing symbol than as knowledge concerning the factual construction of matter. However, in some of Einstein's more recent utterances there have been aspects which seem to us not only mistaken, but posi? However, it constitutes, as a matter of fact, the frst attempt towards the consistent elaboration of a field theory which presents a possibility of explaining the propemes of matter. However, since for the time being we depend upon the cumbersome method of "open letters" I shall want to indicate briefly my reaction to your arguments. However, the Gauss treatment for ds2 which we have given above is not always possible.
However, the anxious care with which the United States keep out foreign goods by means of prohibitive tariffs certainly contrasts oddly with the general picture. However, the desire of nations to be constantly prepared for warfare has, however, still other repercussions upon the lives of men. However, the error increases substantially with increasing density and decreasing temperature, and is quite sizeable for Helium in the vicinity of the critical state; on the other hand, one can then no longer consider the gas as ideal. However, the field of a sphere with a negative charge will be iden- tical with a gravitational field since the small positive testing charge will be attracted by the source of the field. However, the fixation will never be final.
However, the following postulate is exactly sufficient for a solution: The L? However, the general relativity postulate offers nothing new about the essence of the other natural processes, which wasn't already taught by the special theory of relativity. However, the most careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical space, i.e. However, the procedure justifies itself because it was clear from the very beginning that the postulates of the theory are not strong enough to deduce from them sufficiently complete equations for physical events sufficiently free from arbitrariness, in order to base upon such a foundation a theory of measuring rods and clocks.
However, the production and distribution of co=odities is entirely unorganized so that everybody must live in fear of being eliminated from the economie cycle, in this way suffering far the want of everything.

However, the sincere pacifists to-day who mean to accomplish something must take this stand in times of peace, and in those countries where military service is compulsory the effect will be great.
However, the situation just described has a serious politica} facet. However, the systern of equations (14) allows a readily suggested extension which is compatible with the relativity postulato, and is perf ectly analogous to the extension of Poisson's equation given by equation (2). However, the theorem of the addition of speeds rests on arbitrary axioms. However, there are indirect methods for measuring their weights exactly. However, there seems to be no such thing, whether on the basis of experi- ence or according to Maxwell's equa- tions. However, there still exist widely divergent opinions concerning the degree to which traditional social and politica!forms, historically developed, will have to be sacrificed in arder to achieve the desired security.
However, this appears to be as good as impossible. However, this refusal to testify must not be based on the well-known subterfuge of invoking the Fif th Amendment against possible self-incrimination, but on the assertion that it is shameful far a blameless citizen to submit to such an inquisi? However, we obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we carry out the analogous consideration for a ray of light. However, we should be wary of believing that its execution would irrunediately result in security. However, what we are looking for are the equations satisfied by "generai" gravita? However, when v is small with respect to e, the momentum with respect to K is the same except for a quantity of second arder of magnitude ( V: e compared to 1).
However, while the whole life process of ants and bees is fixed down to the smallest detail by rigid, hereditary instincts, the social pattern and interrelationships of human beings are very variable and susceptible to change. However, while the whole life process of ants and bees is fxed down to the smallest detail by rigid, hereditary instincts, the social pattern and interrelationships of human beings are very variable and susceptible to change. However, with the affairs of active human beings it is dif? Hubble's discovery can, therefore, be considered to some extent as a confirmation of the theory. Human society, as a whole, seemed stable. Human thought creates an ever-changing picture of the universe.
Hume has permanently influenced the development of the best of philosophers who came after him. Hume has permanently influenced the development of the best of philosophers who carne after him. Hume saw that concepts which we must regard as essential, such as, for example, causal connection, cannot be gained from materia! Hume saw that concepts which we must regard as essential, such as, for example, causal connection, cannot be gained from material given to us by the senses. Hunger, love, pain, fear are some of those inner forces which rule the individua! Huygens believed that the ether would turn out to be " air-like" rather than "jelly-like". Hydrodynamics explains the process by which this stationary distribution of velocities is established in the following way.
Hypotheses on the radiative exchange of energy Let Zn and Zm be two quantum-theoretically possible states of the gas molecule, whose energies are en and em, respectively, and satisfy the inequality em>en. Hypothesis (2) appeared unavoidable to me at the time, since I thought that one would get into bottomless speculations if one departed from it. I CONSIDER IT IMPORTANT, indeed urgently necessary, for intellectual workers to get together, both to protect their own economie status and also, generally speaking, to secure their inHuence in the political field. I GLADLY accede to the request of your colleague to write something for The Times on relativity.
I Now I want to show 3 ou how we can arrive at the changed concepts about time and space from mechanics, as accepted now-a-days, from purely mathematical considera- tions. I ON THE MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES SUSPENDED IN A STATIONARY LIQUID KINETIC THEORY OF HEAT DEMANDED BY THE MOLECULAR- I N this paper it will be shown that according to the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, bodies of microscopically-visible size suspended in a liquid will perform movements of such magnitude that they can be easily observed in a microscope, on account of the molecular motions of heat. I add that another argument involving the spatial distribution of the energy gives exactly the same results as those given above.
I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler. I admit that the ratio of the circumference c of a circle to its radius r depends on r, but for a given value of r it is the same for all points of the " worldsphere "; in other words, the " world-sphere " is a " surface of constant curvature." I advise and advocate very warmly and strongly the creation of an International War Resisters' Fund to support the active war resisters of our day. I also believe that a simple and unassuming !ife is good far everr.body, physically and mentally.
I also believe that capitalism, or, we should say, the system of free enterprise, will prove unable to check unemployment, which will become increas? I also consider that plain living is good for everybody, physically and mentally. I also had the good fortune of getting to know the essential results and methods of the entire field of the natural sciences in an excellent popular exposi- tion, which limited itself almost throughout to qualitative aspects (Bernstein's "People's Books on Natural Science," a work of five or six volumes), a work which I read with breathless attention. I also share your conviction that steps absolutely must be taken to make it possible and necessary for the younger people to take part in the productive process.
I am :firmly convinced that whoever believes this suffers from a fatal misconception. I am absolutely convinced that no wealth in the world can help humanity forward, even in the hands of the most devoted worker in this cause. I am also of opinion that fluctuations in the value of money must be avoided, by substituting for the gold standard a standard based on certain classes of goods selected according to the conditions of consumption as Keynes, if I am not mistaken, long ago proposed. I am also of the opinion that fiuctuations in the value of money must be avoided, by substituting far the gold standard .
I am convinced that demonstrative reference to armaments are but a weapon in the hands of the factors interested in their production or in the maintenance and development of a military system for financial or political egotistic reasons. I am convinced that every man who reads Herr Gumbel's books with an open mind will get the same impression from them as I have. I am convinced that in doing that we shall also indirectly be promoting those general human ends which we must always recognize as the highest. I am convinced that such legislation can be brought about. I am convinced that the great men those whose achievements, even though in a restricted sphere, set them above their fellows are animated to an overwhelming extent by the same ideals.
I am convinced that the philosophers have had a harmful effect upon the progress of scientific thinking in removing certain fundamental concepts from the domain of empiricism, where they are under our control, to the intangible heights of the a priori. I am convinced that the present difficulties between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. are not due primarily to ideological differ? I am convinced that we can discover by means oi purely mathematical constructions the concepts ind the laws connecting them with each other, which furnish the key to the understanding of natural phe- nomena. I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals.
I am convinced tl1at every man who reads Mr. Gumbel's books with an open mind will get the same impression from them as I have. I am doing this because I believe that it is a good thing to show those who are striving alongside us how one*s own striving and searching appear to one in retrospect. I am even inclined to go a step further by the assertion that, under present day conditions any one state would incur no appreciable risk by undertaking to disarm wholly regardless of the attitude of the other states. I am firmly convinced that the passionate will for justice and truth has done more to improve man's condition thai:l. calculating politica!shrewdness which in the long run only breeds genera!distrust.
I am firmly convinced that thus we shall serve in directly the aims of humanity in general, which aims forever must remain, with us, the highest. I am firmly of the opinion that the educational effect of a first and genuine achievement in the realm of disarmament would prove highly efficacious, because the succeeding second and third steps would then be immeasurably simpler than the initial one; this for the obvious reason that the first results of an understanding would considerably weaken the familiar argument for national security with which parliamentarians of all countries now permit them selves to be intimidated. I am inclined to the view that the State can only be of real use to industry as a limiting and regulative force.
I am inclined to the view that the state can only be of real use to industry as a limiting and regolative farce. I am most grateful to you for according me an opportunity to give you my views in person. I am no longer young and can, therefore, say, that as a child and as a young man I experienced that phase-when a young man thinks only about the trivialities of persona!existence, and talks like his fellows and behaves like them. I am not able to speak from any :firsthand knowledge about the development of the atomic bomb, since I do not work in this field. I am not one of these pessimists; I believe that better times are coming.
I am not satisfied myself with those answers and I am willing to answer more questions if you believe this could be of any advantage far the very interesting and diflicult work you have undertaken, (A) The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any rle in my mechanism of thought. I am not saying that the United States should not manufac? I am not thinking here so much of the democratic politica!constitution of this country, however highly it must be praised. I am not thinking so much of the dangers with which technical progress has directly confronted mankind, as of the stif!ing of mutua! I am not trying in this communication to deduce the general Relativity-theory as the simplest logical system possible, with a minimum of axioms.
I am of the opinion that all thinking men should take a solemn pledge never to participate in any military activity, directly or indirectly. I am of the opinion that this policy has detracted from the very real virtue in the offer of supra? I am only speaking in symbols. I am quite aware that it is necessary far the achievement of the objective of an organization that one man should do the think? I am quite aware that it is necessary for the success of any complex undertaking that one man should do the thinking and directing and in general bear the responsibility.
I am quite aware that we have just now light- heartedly expelled in imagination many excellent men who are largely, perhaps chiefly, responsible for the building of the temple of Science; and in many cases our angel would find it a pretty ticklish job to decide. I am rarely enthusiastic about what the League of Nations has done or has not done, but I am always thankful that it exists. I am ready to stand by every word I have published. I am satisfied with the mystery of the etemity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world, together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature. I am skeptical that this form presents dangers com?
I am speaking now of the religion of fear. I am standing in front of a gas range. I am still inclined to the view that physicists will not in the long run content themselves with that sort of indirect description of the real, even if the theory can eventually be adapted to the postulate of general relativity in a satisfactory manner. I am strongly drawn to a frugal!ife and am often oppressively aware that I am engrossing an undue amount of the labor of my fellow-men. I am strongly drawn to the simple life and am often oppressed by the feeling that I am engrossing an unnecessary amount of the labour of my fellow-men. I am sure that as little as a century ago no one would have so lightly made a statement of this kind.
I am sure the reader will appreciate with sufficient clearness what I mean here by " neighbouring " and by " jumps " (if he is not too pedantic). I am sure you are convinced that this letter is written with all the seriousness and honesty at my command; I trust you will accept it in the same spirit. I am surprised at this, even if I have never seen either a gas range or a pan before. I am thinking of the relationship between individuai people and of the atti? I am thinking of the theory of mass motion and gravitation which Newton gave us and the concept of the electro-magnetic field, by means of which Faraday and Clerk Maxwell put physics on a new basis.
I am truly a "Ione traveler" and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need far solitude-feelings whch increase with the years. I am very pleased with this suggestion, but for all that I cannot regard the matter as quite settled, because I feel constrained to raise the following objection: "Your definition would certainly be right, if only I knew that the light by means of which the observer at M perceives the lightning flashes travels along the length A M with the same velocity as along the length B M. But an examination of this supposition would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the means of measuring time.
I am writing this letter in German because I am not capable of writing it in English myself and because I want myself to bear the entire responsibility for it. I and my colleague discovered that these 'spinors' constitute a special case of a field of a new sort which is mathematically connected with the metrical continuum of four dimensions, and it seems that they are naturally fitted to describe important properties of the electrical elementary particles. I answer without hesitation that there is, in my opinion, a right way, and that we are capable of finding it. I answer, the man who regards his own life and that of his fellow-creatures as meaningless is not merely unfortunate but almost disqualified for life.
I answer: The man who regards his own life and that of his fellow creatures as meaningless is not merely unhappy but hardly lit for life. I appreciate that there are persons who favor a graduai approach to world government, even though they approve of it as the ultimate objective. I appreciate the effort they have made and I appreciate even more the fact that they have expressed their point of view so candidly and straightf orwardly. I ask first: How far does the iv function describe a real condition of a mechanical system? I ask you to help us in fulfilling our task. I attach special importance to the view of geometry which I have just set forth, because without it I should have been unable to formulate the theory of relativity.
I based that investigation on the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space, together with the Maxwellian expression for the electromagnetic energy of space, and in addition the principle that:N The laws by which the states of physical systems alter are independent of the alternative, to which of two systems of coordinates, in uniform motion of parallel translation relatively to each other, these alterations of state are referred (principle of relativity). I bave known cbildren who preferred schooltime to vacation. I bave read abou.t sixteen pages of your manuscript and it made me-smile. I bave seen and experienced too many dreadful warnings, even in compara? I bave spoken fully about in what spirit, according to my opinion, youth sbould be instructed.
I beg that you will continue to believe in my gratitude and my industry even when my efforts seem to you to yield but a poor result. I begin with a little experiment which anybody can easily repeat. I believe for a number of reasons that it is. I believe for a number of reasons that it is.Let us first consider the question from the point of view of scientific knowledge. I believe he should speak out freely on what he sees and feels, for by so doing he may perhaps prove himself usef ul. I believe in intuition and inspiration. I believe in the actuality of Jewish nationality, and I believe that every Jew has duties toward his coreligionists.
I believe that a refusal on conscientious grounds to serve in the army when called up, if carried out by 50,000 men at the same moment, would be irresistible. I believe that in this respect the United States of America bave faund the right way. I believe that in this respect the United States of America have found the right way. I believe that inter national legislation should be advocated to the effect that those who declare them selves as war resisters should be allowed during peace times to take up different kinds of strenuous or even dangerous work, either for their own countries or for the international benefit of mankind. I believe that the American nation is only imperfectly aware of the responsibility which rests with it in this matter.
I believe that the first step in the set The very fact that the totality of our ting of a "real external world" is the for sense experiences is such that by means mation of the concept of bodily objects of thinking (operations with concepts, and the creation and use of definite func and of bodily objects of various kinds. I believe that the first step in the setting of a "real external world" is the formation of the concept of bodily objects and of bodily 6bjects of various kinds. I believe that the responsible leaders of the nations do, in the main, honestly desire to abolish war. I believe that these difficulties are more psychological than real, and that they can be got over if both sides bring honesty and good will to the task. I believe that whoever tries to think things through hon?
I believe this policy is a mistake. I believe three men can succeed in writing a workable constitution acceptable to them all. I believe with President Wilson in self determination for nations and for individuals. I believe, indeed, that overemphasis on the purely intellectual attitude, often directed solely to the practical and factual, in our education, has led directly to the impairment of ethical values. I believe, moreover, that those whose duty it is to tackle the problem profes- sionally and practically are growing only too aware of their impotence to deal with it, and have now a very lively desire to learn the views of men who, absorbed in the pursuit of science, can see world- problems in the perspective distance lends.
I believe, therefore, that it is ay duty to bring To your attention, the following facts and recommendations: In the course of the last four months, it has become probable ~ Through the work of Joliot in France, as well as Yermi and Szilard in America - that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reetton sm a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quant ities of now radioactive elements would be generated. I believed only that it was theoretically possible. I call this the religion of fear. I can draw four world-axes with the chalk. I can easily supply energy to the gives away no money ( energy ). I can escape the feeling of complicity in it only by speaking out.
I can get from any one point on this table to any other point by passing continuously from one point to a " neighbouring " one, and repeating this process a (large) number of times, or, in other words, by going from point to point without executing "jumps." I can represent to myself a spherical surface well enough, but nothing analogous to it in three dimensions. I can represent to myself a spherical surface well enough, but nothing analogous to it in three dimensions." I can see no wrong in enlightened patriotism, in love of country and of race. I can still remember N or at least believe I can remember N that this experience made a deep and lasting impression upon me.
I can, indeed, associate numbers with the events, in such a way that a greater number is associated with the later event than with an earlier one; but the nature of this association may be quite arbitrary. I cannot be satisfied with this answer for the following reason. I cannot but confess that I attach only a transitory importance to this interpretation, I still believe in the possibility of a model of reality ^that is to say, of a theory which represents things themselves and not merely the probability of their occurrence. I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experi? I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the type of which we are conscious in ourselves.
I cannot conceive of a genuine scientist without that profound faith. I cannot help confessing that I myself accord to this interpretation no more than a transitory significance. I cannot let this occasion pass without referring in a spirit of thankfulness to the fact that American patronage of science is not limited by national frontiers. I cannot let this opportunity pass without paying a tribute to the way in which the desire to preserve the confraternity of the intellect has remained alive through all these difficult years in the breasts of a large number of our English colleagues especially. I cannot refrain from showing that no contradiction to the assumption on the relativity-postulate can be expected from the phenomena of gravitation.
I carne to admire her human grandeur to an ever growing degree. I con- cIuHe, therefore, that my patient's temperature is that registered on the thermometer." I conclude with a warm appeal to the Jews in Germany to contribute all they can, in spite of the present economic difficulties, for the building up of the Jewish home in Palestine. I could stand near one of the clocks and look at a televised picture of the other. I could then judge whether or not they showed the same time simultaneously. I did not do this comfortably but with a well?
I did not find the way out of this dilemma till 1912, and then it came to me as a result of the following considera- tion : A new formulation of the law of inertia had to be found which in case of the absence of a real gravita- tional field with application of an inertial system as a co-ordinate system passed over into Galileos for- mula for the principle of inertia. I did not, in fact, foresee that it would be released in my time. I dislike to apply a yardstick to such imponderables as genius. I dismiss this on the ground that if it could happen from a man-made atomic explosion it would already have happened from the action of the cosmic rays which are continually reaching the earth's surface.
I do net believe that the remedy far our present difficulties lies in a knowledge of productive capacity and consumption, because this knowledge is likely, in the main, to come tao late. I do net intend to argue with you about what inroads on human liberty may be justified by reasons of state. I do not at ali believe in buman freedom in the philosophical sense. I do not believe it is necessary to go on beyond these possi? I do not believe it should be given to the Soviet Union. I do not believe that a great era of atomic science is to be assured by organizing science, in the way large corporations are organized. I do not believe that civilization will be wiped out in a war fought with the atomic bomb.
I do not believe that the secret of the bomb should be given to the United Nations Organization. I do not believe that we bave made any genuine advance in this area during the last few thousand years. I do not believe there is a way in which this deeply en? I do not believe we ought to if we wish to remain consistent ; we must rather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither reason nor known mechanical laws. I do not believe, however, that so elementary an ideal could do much to kindle the investigators pas- sion from which really great achievements have arisen. I do not consider myself the father of the release of atomic energy. I do not even consider it impossible that this question will be answered before long by astronomy.
I do not share the pessimisrn of those who believe that full intellectual growth is dependent on the foundation of open or concealed slavery. I do not tbink that this is tbe rigbt way to put tbe question. I do not think such a standpoint is justi:fed. I do not think that this is the right way to put the question. I don't want to make an exhaustive list of well-known accomplishments, but rather concentrate on one main point, on which the electromagnetic and the mechanical theories of light agree or rather, seem to agree. I enunciate in the following manner the general theorem of relativity corresponding to the equations (I) (iv),which are the fundamental equations for Ather. I fear historians never have taken the factor of mass psychology sufficiently into account in writing history.
I feel the need of sending my congratulations and good wishes to your Ethical Cu!ture Society on the occasion of its anniver? I find, however, that the opposite has happened. I first came a step nearer to the solution of the problem when I attempted to deal with the law of gravity within the framework of the special theory of relativity. I for my part am grateful to fate for having given me this man, with his inexhaustible goodness and high creative gifts, for a friend. I further suggest that war resisters should organize themselves internationally and collect funds to support those resisters in the different countries who to-day cannot make progress because of lack of financial backing.
I further want to rernark that the theory of expanding space, together with the empirical data of astronomy, permit no decision to be reached about the finite or infinite character of (three-dimensional) space, while the original " static " hypothesis of space yielded the closure (finiteness) of space. I gang my own gait and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties I have never lost an obstinate sense of detachment, of the need for solitude a feeling which increases with the years. I give the complete consideration again at this place, so that the reader is not forced to uninterruptedly consultate the earlier reports. I gladly accept this award as an expression of friendly senti?
I had also already studied some theoretical physics v/hen, at the age of seventeen, I en- tered the Polytechnic Institute of Zurich. I had no serious doubts about its strict validity even without knowing the results of the admirable experi- ments of Eotvos, which if my memory is right I only came to know later. I had promised to say something about Russell as philosopher and epistemologist. I had rather put these proposals to you than to anyone else in the world, because you are least of all men the dupe of your desires and because your critical judgment is supported by a most earnest sense of responsibility. I have a warm admiration far the achievements of American REPLY TO THE WOMEN OF AMERICA 7 institutes of scientific research.
I have a warm admiration for the achievements of American institutes of scientific research. I have already attempted to show that the present principles of the theory of radiation must be abandoned. I have already, in my last letter, characterized this accusation as slanderous. I have always been annoyed by the undignified assimilationist cravings and strivings which I have observed in so many of my friends. I have considered this most important proposal, which has a bearing on several things that I have nearly at heart, carefully from every angle. I have daily occasion for observing that the greatest obstacle which the work of our Commission has to encounter is the lack of confidence in its political impartiality.
I have fetENERALlSED THEORY OF RELATIVITY loS found out that this is indeed the case. I have given it as the reason for my resignation from the Prussian Academy that in the present circumstances I have no wish either to be a German citizen or to remain in a position of quasi-dependence on the Prussian Ministry of Education. I have had the privilege of seeing, to my great joy and satisfaction, how much this achievement has contributed to the recovery of the Jewish people, which is exposed, as a minority among the nations, not merely to external dangers, but also to internal ones of a psychological nature.
I have in part B of this communication developed in the simplest and clearest manner, all the supposed mathematical auxiliaries, not known to Physicists, which will be useful for our purpose, so that, a study of the mathematical literature is not necessary for an understanding of this paper. I have just now referred to a group of facts for the theoretical treatment of which the principles are lacking. I have known instances where individuals of unusual mora! I have met no one wbo combined ali these qualities in himself so perfectly as H. A. Lorentz. I have met no one who combined all these qualities in himself so perfectly as H. A. Lorentz. I have now reached the point where I may indicate briefly what to me constitutes the essence of the crisis of our time.
I have often heard colleagues try to attribute this attitude of his to extraordinary will-power and discipline ^wrongly, in my opinion. I have put all this with brutal frankness for the sake of brevity, but I know from your writings that you are a man who attends to the sense, not the form. I have received your communication of the seventh instant and deeply deplore the mental attitude displayed in it. I have seen a supremely courageous little band of colonists weighted down under an enormous burden of debts which some of their enthusiastic Zionist brethren could so easily have lightened. I have seen and experienced too many dreadful warnings, even in comparatively model Switzerland.
I have seen our youth in Palestine cheer fully doing hard labor which better and more modern equipment could have rendered less difficult and more productive. I have shown in two recently published reports, how one can arrive at field equations of gravitation, that are in agreement with the postulate of general relativity, i.e. I have specially in mind that small but determined group, active in every nation, composed of indi- viduals who, indifferent to social consider- ations and restraints, regard warfare, the manufacture and sale of arms, simply as an occasion to advance their personal interests and enlarge their personal autho- rity. I have spoken fully about in what spirit, according to my opinion, youth should be instructed.
I have tried, however, to present the problem with a view to a su:fficiently swift realization that will allow us to avoid difficulties greater than those already inherent in the nature of such a task. I hereby declare that I have never taken any part in atrocity-mongering, and I must add that I have seen nothing of any such mongering anywhere. I hold that mankind is approaching an era in which peace treaties will not only be recorded on paper, but will also become inscribe in the hearts of men. I hope that healthy conditions will soon supervene in Germany, and that in future her great men like Kant and Goethe will not merely be commemorated from time to time, but that the principles which they inculcated will also prevail in public life and in the general consciousness.
I hope with ali my heart that the new Institute by constant interaction with the Comrnission will succeed in promoting their common ends and winning the confidence and recognition of intellectual workers all aver the world. I hope with all my heart that the new Institute, by constant interaction with the Commission, will succeed in promoting their common ends and winning the confidence and recognition of intellectual workers all over the world. I human being the sum total of his direct and indirect relations I to his contemporaries and to all the people of earlier general relations. I imagine to myself, each such singular point surrounded by a field that has essentially the same character as a plane wave, and whose amplitude decreases with the distance between the singular points.
I knew him well as an extraordinarily helpful, conscientious man of unusually independent character and I rather frequently had the pleasure of discussing with him problems of common 80 IDE.AS AND OPINIONS interest. I know Liberal economists maintain that every economy in labor is counterbalanced by an increase in demand. I know Liberal economists maintain that every economy in labour is counterbalanced by an increase in demand. I know it is argued that no other country has money enough to spend on the development of the atomic bomb, which assures us the secret for a long time. I know that in your writings we may find answers, explicit or implied, to all the issues of this urgent and absorbing problem. I know that it is a hopeless undertaking to debate about fundamental value judgments.
I know that the schools in this coun? I know that the schools in this country are free from this worst evi! I live in that solitude which is painf ul in youth, but de? I lived in solitude in the country and noticed how the monotony of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind. I look upon it as the essence of an attitude to life which is incarnate in the Jewish people rather than the essence of the laws laid down in the Thora and interpreted in the Talmud. I look upon the attempt as nothing less than an imperative duty. I make no pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties which are inherent to the subject. I make the additional assertion that these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously.
I may add that a special fund for the university, entirely distinct from the general fund for the development of the country, has been opened. I may be permitted to express the hope that this internationalism of the American nation, which proceeds from a high sense of responsibility, will very soon extend itself to the sphere of politics. I merely state the result here. I must not fail to mention that a theoretical argument can be adduced in favour of the hypothesis of a finite universe. I must redeem my promise to say something about my impres? I must take a stand with reference to the most successful physical theory of our period, viz., the statis- tical quantum theory which, about twenty-five years ago, took on a con- sistent logical form (Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Dirac, Born) .
I must take television pictures of the two clocks at a point equally distant from each of them and observe them from this centre point. I must try, however, as best I can, although I am very conscious of the fact that our feelings and strivings are often contradictory and obscure and that they cannot be expressed in easy and simple formulas. I must try, however, as best I can, although I am very conscious of the fact that our feelings and strivings are often contradictory and obscure and that they cannot be expressed in easy and simple formulas.Man is, at one and the same time, a solitary being and a social being. I myself do not have the gif t of explanation with which I am able to persuade large numbers of people of the urgency of the problems the human race now faces.
I need not care whether or not the source of light or other bodies are moving, for they never carry my ether-sea with them. I need not dwell on the point that freedom of teaching and of opinion in book or press is the foundation for the sound and natural development of any people. I notice that steam is being emitted continuously from the one pan, but not from the other. I now abandoned as inade- quate the attempt to treat the problem of gravitation, in the manner outlined above, within the framework of the special theory of relativity. I now ask: Do the "positions" traversed by the stone lie "in reality" on a straight line or on a parabola? I once said of him that his plays remind me of Mozart.
I only believe that there exists on one hand talent and on the other hand developed qualifications. I only know that I affirm them with rny whole soul, and would find it intolerable to belong to a society which consistently denied thern. I only need state how many rods I must pass over when, starting from the origin, I proceed towards the " right " and then " upwards," in order to arrive at the corner of the square under consideration. I only wish to bring in one of its consequences, for it brings with it certain modifications of the fundamental ideas of physics. I only wished to illustrate that the two structural properties of radiation according to Planck's formula (oscillation structure and quantum structure) should not be considered incompatible with one another.
I owe innumerable happy hours to the reading of Russell's works, something which I cannot say of any REM.ARK5 ON BERTRAND RUSSELL'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 19 other contemporary scientilc writer, with the exception of Thorstein Veblen. I owe innumerable happy hours to the reading of Russell's works, something which I cannot say of any other contemporary scientific writer, with the exception of Thorstein Veblen. I personally am also grateful to you for the unforgettable words which you have addressed to my mythical namesake who makes life so difficult for me, although he is really, for all his clumsy, formidable size, quite a harmless fellow.

I realized that the only possible salvation for the race was that every Jew in the world should become attached to a living society to which the individual rejoiced to belong and which enabled him to bear the hatred and the humiliations that he has to put up with from the rest of the world. I recently discussed with an intelligent and well-d1s?
I recently discussed with an intelligent and well-disposed man the threat of another war, which in my opinion would seriously endanger the existence of mankind, and I remarked that only a supra-national organization would offer protection from that danger. I recommend the recruiting of people with this idea in all parts of the world. I refer to a form of oath in which fidelity to the Fascist system is to be promised. I refer to an oath of loyalty to the Fascist system. I regard class differences as contrary to justice and, in the last resort, based on force. I regard class distinctions as unjustified and, in the last resort, based on farce. I regard it as the chief duty of the State to protect the individual and give him the opportunity to develop into a creative personality.
I restrict myself bere to neutra!particles because, in another recent publication in collaboration with Dr. Rosen, I bave treated this question in a detailed manner, and because th.e essentials of the problem can be completely shown by this case. I salute tlie man who is going tlirough lif e always helpful, knowing no fear, and to whom aggressiveness and resentment are alien. I saw how schools, comic papers, and innumerable other forces of the Gentile majority undermined the confidence even of the best of my fellow-Jews, and felt that this could not be allowed to continue. I saw worthy Jews basely caricatured, and the sight made my heart bleed.
I say that nothing has been done to avert war since the completion of the atomic bomb, despite the proposal for supranational control of atomic energy put forward by the United States in the United Nations. I say this merely to indicate that socialism as such cannot be considered the solution to all social problems but merely as a framework within which such a solution is possible. I say this to stress that the American government must keep the contro!of atomic energy, not because socialism is necessarily desirable, but because atomic energy was developed by the government, and it would be unthinkable to turn over this property of the people to any individuals or groups of individuals.
I see a certain military gain from not renouncing the use of the bomb in that this may be deemed to restrain another country from starting a war in which the United States might use it. I shall T therefore begin with a brief investigation of the origin of our ideas of space and time, although in doing so I know that I introduce a controversial subject. I shall add a fe ,v more remarks here in order to elucidate the conception of space-time vector of the 2nd kind. I shall agai!i use the geometrical method of expression. I shall also show on a later occasion that the deduction of these equations, as taught by Lorentz, are by no means to be given up. I shall always look back on these two months with pleasure and gratitude. I shall briefly indicate my own thoughts on this point.
I shall call the space-time vector $ of the first kind as the Electric Best Force.^ Relations analogous to those holding between -wF, E, M, U, hold amongst mf, e, m, u, and in particular w/ is normal to oj. I shall denote the vector electric force by E,' the magnetic induction by M_, the electric induction by e and the magnetic force by 7n, so that (E, M, ?, m) are used instead of Lorentz's (E, B, D, H) respectively. I shall further make use of complex magnitudes in a way which is not yet current in physical investigations, i.e., instead of operating with {t), I shall operate with {it), where i denotes ^ \. I shall leave open, for the time being, the question as to how far the indi?
I shall not go into detail concerning those properties of the space of reference which lead to our conceiving points as elements of space, and space as a continuum. I shall now collect the results. I shall now con- sider the position of the Newtonian law of attraction to this postulate. I shall now describe the ponderomoiive force whicJi is exerted hij one moving electron upon Q7iother moving electron. I shall now show that, according to the generai theory of relativity, there exist singularity-free solutions of field equa? I shall now write {x^ x^ x^ x ^) for {x^y, z, t) and (/>nP2; ^3; P4) for (pu,, puy, pu,, ip) i.e. I shall prepare the reader for this in the following paragraphs.
I shall show in our figure that Lorentz's hypothesis is fully equivalent to the new conceptions about time and space. I shall try here to sketch the line of thought of de Broglie and Schrodinger, which lies closer to the physicist's method of thinking, and shall accompany the description with certain genera!considerations. I share your view that a socialist economy possesses ad? I should like to discuss this important problem only after having said a few words about the antagonism between socialism and capitalism; for your attitude on the significance of this antagonism seems to domi?
I should like to express the hope that our University will always be free from this evil, that teachers and students will always preserve the conscious ness that they serve their people best when they maintain its union with humanity and with the highest human values. I should like to see how your theory, even if we waive the difficulties, explains those phenomena which are so clear and understandable in the light of the corpuscular theory. I should like to take this opportunity of telling my friend Berliner and the readers of this paper why I rate him and his work so highly. I should load my conscience with grave sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the aims of mechanics in this way, without serious reflection and detailed explanations.
I should not make up my mind to it unti! I should say parenthetically that it is well that this country has not taken these precautions, for to have done so would make atomic war still more probable, since it would convince the rest of the world that we are resigned to it and are pre? I should shrink from repeating them, were it not that they are for ever threatening to fall into oblivion, particularly in these days of organization and mechanization. I soon saw that bringing in non-linear transforma- tions, as the principle of equivalence demanded, was inevitably fatal to the simple physical interpretation of the co-ordinates i.e., that it could no longer be re- quired that differentials of co-ordinates should signify direa results of measurement with ideal scales or clocks.
I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is travelling uniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, without throwing it. I still believe in the possibility of giving a model of reality, a theory, that is to say, which shall represent events themselves and not merely the probability of their occurrence. I suffered at the hands of my teacbers a similar treatment; they disliked me far my independence and passed me aver wben they wanted assistants (I must admit, though, that I was somewhat Iess of a model student than you). I suffered exactly the same treatment at the hands of my teachers, who disliked me for my independence and passed me over when they wanted assistants (I must admit that I was somewhat less of a model student than you).
I suggest to your organization (The New History Society) that you discuss these proposals at your coining meetings and adopt them, and I am pretty sure that whosoever takes the initiative along these lines, will, sooner or later, bring about such international legislation. I thank you most heartily for this magnificent reception and, in particular, the men of learning in this country for the cordial and friendly welcome I have received from them. I think it is terrible that this should be so and I suffer more than anybody can imagine. I think of such occupations as the service in lighthouses and lightships. I too am in favour of abolishing large cities, but not of settling people of a particular type e.g., old people in particular towns.
I trust that posterity will read these statements with a feel? I trust that posterity will read these statements with a feeling of proud and justiled superiority. I try to demonstrate how the concepts of bodily objects, space, subjective and objective time, are connected with one another and with the nature of the experience. I try to demonstrate, furthermore, why in my opinion the quantum theory does not seem likely to be able to produce a usable foundation for physics: one becomes involved in con? I want now to glance for a moment at the development of the theoretical method, and while doing so especially to observe the relation of pure theory to the totality of the data of experience. I want to indicate now why this conception appears to me to be so fateful.
I want to indicate now why tllls conception appears to me to be so fatefui. I want to show that without any extraordinary difficulty we can illustrate the theory of a finite universe by means of a mental image to which, with some practice, we shall soon grow accustomed. I was a free man, bound neither by many duties nor by harassing responsibilities; my friend, on the contrary, was never free from the grip of urgent duties and anxious fears for the fate of those in peril. I was in the highest degree amazed at its persistence and guessed that in it must lie the key to a deeper understanding of inertia and gravitation.
I was led to these hypotheses by my endeavour to postulate for the molecules, in the simplest possible manner, a quantum-theoretical behaviour that would be the analogue of the behaviour of a Planck resonator in the classical theory. I was much bothered by this piece of knowl- edge, for it took me a long time to see what co-ordi- nates in general really meant in physics. I was of course acquainted with Mach's view, ac- cording to which it appeared conceivable that what inertial resistance counteracts is not acceleration as such but acceleration with respect to the masses of the other bodies existing in the world.
I we compare with this expression the previous for- mulie"^ giving the elementary law about the pouderomotive action of moving electric charges upon each other, then we cannot but admit, that the relations which occur here reveal the inner essence of full simplicity first in four dimensions ; but in three dimensions, they have very com- plicated projections. I we take the priucipal result of the Lorentz traDsfor- mation together with the fact that the system (A) as well as the system (B) is covariant with respect to a rotation of the coordinate-system round the null point, we obtain the general relativity theorem.
I will assume that two point-masses 7}i and m^ describe their world-lines ; a moving force-vector is exercised by m upon m^, and the expression is just the same as in the case of the electron, only we have to write \-mm^ instead of 6'6'i. I will attempt to answer this question as far as it is possible to do so without using mathematical lan- guage. I will call a space-point plus a time-point, i.e., a system of values X, y^ r, /, as a world-point. I will call it the cosmic religious sense. I will denote by V^ a purely imaginary magnitude, and consider the substitution ^i^\i ^s'=*2> ^^^' = xz cos i\if-\-x^ sin iyj/, (1) ^^4' = ic, sin ixjf 4- .^4 cos i\^, Putting - i tan i^^ = '\^ "^ _^ = ^' ^^= 9 ^og jz^r (2) (?
I will not attempt here a comparison of the slender experimental material at my disposal with the (*) A. Einstein, Ann. I will not bother you with any further argurnents, since you will understand my resolve well enough frorn these few hints. I will not speak here of the way this theory has been confirmed by experience, but explain at once wh3 Theory could not rest permanently satisfied with this success. I will not weary the reader by enumerating further conten? I will not weary the reader by enumerating further contentions which do not seem to me to get to the heart of the matter. I will not worry you with any further arguments, since you will understand my resolve yell enough from these few hints.
I will now give equations (47) in a third form, which is particularly useful for a vivid grasp of our subject. I will now justif y this opinion. I will now proceed to show, by a familiar example ^that of the scent-spray ^how the principle can be applied. I will now put the equation (47) in a third form which will be very serviceable for a quick realisation of our object. I will now tell you how I think that the present difficulties might be remedied; at the same time I must add that this is only my personal opinion, which I have discussed with nobody.
I will show in a separate paper that the so-called Ostatistical probabilityO is fully adequate for the treatment of thermal phenomena, and I hope that by doing so I will eliminate a logical difficulty that obstructs the application of BoltzmannO s Principle. I wish to point out that the simplif ying assumptions as to the gravitational potentials on which this reasoning is based, have been introduced merely far the sake of lucidity. I wonder how it is with distance? I worked on these problems from 1912 to 1914 to- gether with my friend Grossmann. I would like to reply: essentially 3'es. I would like to write to you at greater length, but cannot find the time. I would rather be hacked in pieces than take part in such an abominable business.
I would rather not belong to any society which behaves in such a manner, even if it does so under external pressure. I, too, am in favor of abolishing large cities, but not of settling people of a particular type, e.g., old people, in particular towns.

IAM WRITING AS ONE who has lived among you in America only a little more than ten years. II Now the question may be asked,what circumstances lead us to these changed views about time and space, are they not in contradiction with observed phenomena, do they finally guarantee us advantages for the description of natural phenomena ?
II ON THE THEORY OF THE BROWNIAN MOVEMENT S OON after the appearance of my paper (*) on the movements of particles suspended in liquids demanded by the molecular theory of heat, Siedentopf (of Jena) informed me that he and other physicists-in the first instance, Prof. Gouy (of Lyons)-had been convinced by direct observation that the so-called Brownian motion is caused by the irregular thermal movements of the molecules of the liquid. II Politics and Pacifism Peace The importance of securing international peace was recognized by the really great men of former generations.

INTRODUCTION 3 characterized by me. INVESTIGATIONS ON THE THEORY OF THE BROWNIAN MOVEMENT. IS HEAT A SUBSTANCE Here we begin to follow a new clue, one originating in the realm of heat phenomena. IT HAS OFTEN BEEN SAID, and certainly not without justification, that the man of science is a poor philosopher. IT IS IN TIMES of economie distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people. IV For the last two thousand years the common property of the Jewish people has consisted entirely of its past.
IV In order to demonstrate that the assumption of the crroup Gc fo^' ^^^ physical laws does not possibly lead to any contradiction, it is unnecessary to undertake a revision of the whole of physics on the basis of the assumptions underlying this group. IV PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY Fizeaic^s experin/cnl,Soon aftur, in 1851, it received direct experimental eonHrmation in a brilliant piece of work by Fizeau. IV The Jews Jewish Ideals The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, an almost fanatical love of justice, and the desire for personal independence these are the features of the Jewish tradition which make me thank my stars that I belong to it. If "matter" exists in the considered space, then its energy tensor appears on the right hand side of (2) or (3).
If $= - , the equation takes the simple form cos $ = - . If (27) is multiplied by ^'^^ ^*'' (mixed multiplication), then a tensor is obtained. If (47b) is multiplied by g^ , suice Qg jXV (T d-^a dga 140 PRINCIPLE or uelativitY aud consequently i) (T a 9f/ a a 99'a 9H 6'/ /Xl' a 9 c/ we obtain the equation 6 / ^ 8H \_ 8H _,^ /ui' 9 i<; a 6. If (A + ?A) is the vector resulting from an infinitesimal parallel displacement from P1 to P2, and (A + dA ) the vector A at the point P2, then the difference of these two, ? If , as is customary, we regard electricity as a moving density of charge, by setting Ju _ dxu ( ) - .j = P([i . If , for example, events consisted merely in the motion of materia!
If , however, we set this tensor = O, we come ba.ck aga.in to the equations Gl'v ,., O. mathematics, from the requirement of the generai theory of relativity, give us, in combination with the equations of. If , in addition, the unit-measure lies on the axis of x, the first of equations (70) gives. If , in place of the variables x1 . If , moreover, at the same time ,.j - g = 1= ,./A3B we obtain from (4), to a frst approximation for small velocities', A. EINSTEIN ) 181 for the componente of momentum, and for the energy (in the static case) m..jB. If , therefore, a law of nature is expressed by equating all the components of a tensor to zero, it is generally covariant.
If ,, y, z, it (space co-ordinates, and time it) is sub- jected to a Lorentz transformation, and at the same time {pu^^ pUy, pu,, ip) (convection-current, and chnrge density pi) is transformed as a space time vector of the 1st kind, further {m^^ 711^, 1^ ,-, i(i ^^ie y^ ie ,) (magnetic force, and electric induction x ( is transformed as a space time vector of the 2nd kind, then the system of equations (1), (II), and the system of equations (III), (IV) trans- forms into essentially corresponding relations between the corresponding magnitudes newly introduced info the system. If ,,j - g were to vanish at a point of the four-dimensional continuum, it would mean that at this point an iofinitely small " natural " volume would correspond to a finite volume in the co-ordinates.
If - = r, an easv calculation li'ives that dt " \/l ' PP jj ^- I - ^-k ft ft ^-fc 4- ^-k * ^ I OD' = 0C '\' " c2, therefore QQ / v^ ' \/ 1 . If / represents a space-time vector of the second kind, lor / denotes a space-time vector of the first kind with the components a ^('' . If /, w;,, n are the direction-cosines of the wave-normal of light in the stationary system, then no energy passes through the surface elements of the spherical surface (xcUy + (y-cmty + (:-~cnfy =11^ which expands with the velocity of light. If A and A' be the amplitudes in the stationarj' and the moving systems (either electrical or magnetic), we have A'2=A' j 1 - cos <i> I 2 1- ^' c^ If $=o, this reduces to the simple form 1-'-! If A is a contra-variant vector, the coefficients of its transformation, xx?'
If Ave apply the operation (27) on an antisymmetrical tensor of the second rank A , and form all the equations arising from the cyclic interchange of the indices /a, v, cr. If B'^ and C are any two vectors, and OENEEALISED THEOEY OF RELATIVITY 111 if for every choice of them the inner product A ^ B C is a scalar, then A is a co-variant tensor. If C is a co-ordinate system in respect to which the Lorentzian ether is at rest, the Maxwell-Lorentz equations hold good first of all in regard to C. Ac- cording to the special theory of relativity these same equations hold good in exactly the same sense in re- gard to any new co-ordinate system C, which is in uniform translatory motion with respect to C. Now comes the anxious question.
If Euclid failed to kindle your youth- ful enthusiasm, then you were not born to be a scientific thinker. If France clings to universal military service, it will be impossible in the long run to prevent its introduction into Germany. If I adopt in this space a vector-field, or in other words, the antisymmetricaltensor-fieldderived from it, and if I look for the simplest laws which such a field can satisfy, I arriveat the Maxwellequationsfor free space. If I am full of confident hope concerning the progress of inter? If I am full of confident hope concerning the progress of international organization in general, that feeling is based not so much on my confidence in the intelligence and high-mindedness of my fellows, but rather on the irresistible pressure of economic developments.
If I analyse the place specification " Times Square, New York," I arrive at the following result. If I ask you whether there is sense in this statement, you will answer my question with a decided "Yes." If I assume a Riemannian metric in it and ask what are the simplest laws which such a metric system can satisfy, I arrive at the relativist theory of gravitation in empty space. If I could only get far away from all material bodies and free myself from all external influences, my c.s. If I had been born a Russian, I believe I could have adjusted myself to this situation. If I nevertheless desire my name to be removed from the list of members, it is for a different reason. If I nourished any hope whatever I should act differently of that you may be sure.
If I present them here in spite of their uncertainty, the reason is not an excessive faith in my own views, but rather the hope to induce one or another of you to deal with the questions considered. If I turn on the light and its source is rigidly con- nected with my room, then the velocity of the light signal has the well-known experimental value 186,000 miles per second. If L is a multiple of the unit matrix, then by lor L will be denoted the matri'x with the elements aL aL aL aL a . If M be the centre of this hyperbola, then we have to deal here .with an ' Inter-hyperbola ' with centre M. Let P = measure of the vector MP, then we easily perceive that the acceleration-vector at P is a vector c^ .
If OA' is parallel to the second y strip, we can take f/ as the .-^-axis and x' as the a;-axis, then the se<^ond body will appear to be at rest, and the first body in uniform motion. If P is a point (event) represented in the four-dimensional space of the x1, x2, x3, l , then all the "points" which can be connected to P by means of a light signal lie upon the cone s2 = 0 (compare Fig. If P is an eigenfunction of the operator A, that is, if A/=ag, In accordance with quantum mechanics we can only say that the relative probability that a measurement of the coordinate will give a result lying between a and b is P(a, b) = PPdx= I dx=b a. If P' lies outside of the "light-cone" then PP' is space-like; in this case, by properly choosing the inertial system, l can be made to vanish.
If R converges to a point (c, ^, r, t), then the quotient of this mass, and the volume of R approaches a limit /x(.t, ^, :, t), which is known as the mass-density at the space-time point The principle of conservation of mass saysthat for an infinitely thin space-time filament, the product /xr/J, where /a= mass-density at the point {^, y^ z, t) of the fila- ment {i.e., the principal line of the filament), ^/J=contents of the cross-section normal to the t axis, and passing through (^^, 2r, t), is constant along the whole filament. If Relativity is to be universally true, then even accelerated motion must be merely relative, motion tjetioeen matter and matter. If S is the volume of the sphere, and S0 that of this ellipsoid, then by a simple calculation S .
If S0 denotes the entropy of a system in some initial state and W denotes the relative probability of a state of entropy S, we obtain in general S ? If U is the number of these rods along the periphery, D the number along the diameter, then, if K' does not rotate relatively to K, we shall have U =1 D But if K' rotates we get a different result. If V is the volume that can be occupied by the molecule, then the phase space volume of all states with an energy ) less than a definite value E is given by (1A). If Zola had felt it necessary to leave France at the time of the Dreyfus case, he would still certainly not have associated himself with a protest by German official personages, however much he might have approved of their action.
If ^^=<3^2^=<X3 4=0^ then (244 = 1, and the Lorentz transformation reduces to a simple rotation of the spatial co-ordinate system round the world-point. If ^oj then the equation takes the simple form 1 v\-s. V =v 1+ C We see thatcontrary to the usual conceptionv=oo, for v= c. If $'=angle between the wave-normal (direction of the ray) in the moving system, and the line of motion of the observer, the equation for I' takes the form cos$ cos ^'= V c 1 -cos <l> c 24 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY This equation expresses the law of observation in its most general form.
If a Planck resonator is located in a radiation field, the energy of the resonator is changed through the work done on the resonator by the electromagnetic field of the radiation; this work can be positive or negative, depending on the phases of the resonator and the oscillating field. If a certain curve be given in our continuum whose points are character- ised by the arc-distances s. measured from a fixed point on the curve, and if further <f>, be an invariant space function", then ~ is also an invariant.
If a co-ordinate system K be so chosen that when re- ferred to it^ the physical laws hold in their simplest forms these laws would be also valid when referred to another system of co-ordinates K' which is subjected to an uniform trauslational motion relative to K. We call this postulate ** The Special Kelativity Principle.'' If a distance ds is associated with the adjacent points P and P1, this distance being measurable and well defined from a physical point of view, then the following formula holds: ds2 = g11dx12 + 2g12dx1dx2 . If a divided beam of light is re-nnited after passin<)j through two adjacent cylinders filled with water, ordinary interference fringes will be produced.
If a free persona!exchange of views should be made possible and should be encouraged, the intellectuals, possibly more than anyone else, could help to create an atmosphere of mutual understanding between the two nations and their problems. If a general law of nature were to be found which did not satisfy this condition, then at least one of the two fundamental assumptions of the theory would have been disproved. If a hot body is brought into contact with a cold one, the heat flows from the hotter to the colder. If a length is measured, the result is expressed as a number of units.
If a material point is at rest relatively to this system of co-ordinates, its position can be defined relatively thereto by the employment of rigid standards of measurement and the methods of Euclidean geometry, and can be expressed in Cartesian co-ordinates. If a measuring- rod is placed beside the tower, we can foretell with what mark on the rod the falling body will coincide at any given moment. If a member dissents he may retire from the Council, but he is not thereby released from the obligation to secrecy. If a molecule absorbs or emits energy e in the form of radiation during its transition from one quantum-theoretically possible state to another, such an elementary process can be thought of as being partially or completely directional, or else symmetrical (non-directional).
If a mov- inoj clock goes slower so that one 'real' second becomes 1/^ second as measured in the moving system, the velocity of light relative to the platform will always remain c. We must adopt two very startling hypotheses, namely, the Fitz -Gerald contraction and the concept of "local time," in order to give a satisfactory explanation of the Miehelson-Morley experiment. If a person masters the fundamentals of his sub? If a person masters the fundamentals of his subject and has leamed to think and work independently, he will surely find his way and besides will better be able to adapt himself to progress and changes than the person whose training principally consists in the acquiring of detailed knowledge.
If a photon of homogeneous light represents an elemen- tary light particle, we can hardly imagine its division and its passage through the two holes. If a pipe, R, with both its ends open, is stood up with its upper end in the zone of high velocity and its lower end in a vessel filled with a liquid, the vacuum at A will draw the liquid upwards out of the vessel, and the liquid on emerging at A will be divided into tiny drops and whisked off by the current of air. If a point-mass of electric unit pole moves in an electro-magnetic field, then besides the electric force, an electromotive force acts upon it, which, neglecting the numbers involving the second and higher powers of !
If a point-mass of electric unit pole moves in an electro-magnetic field, then the force acting upon it is equivalent to the electric force existing at the position of the unit pole, which we obtain by the transformation of the field to a co-ordinate system which is at rest relative to the electric unit pole . If a probability wave in thirty dimensions is needed for the quantum description of ten particles, then a probability wave with an infinite number of dimensions would be needed for the quantum description of a field. If a radiation bundle has the effect that a molecule struck by it absorbs or emits a quantity of energy hv in the form of radiation (ingoing radiation), then a momentum hvjc is always transferred to the molecule.
If a radiation bundle in a given direction does work on a Planck resonator, the corresponding energy is removed from the radiation bundle. If a ray of light be sent along the embankment, we see from the above that the tip of the ray will be transmitted with the velocity c relative to the embankment. If a rigid rod is imagined to be given as the unit measure, the co-ordinates, with a given orientation of the system of co-ordinates, bave a direct physical meaning The unit of time is to be chosen so that th e velocity of light in vacuo as measured in the "local " system of co-ordinates is to be equa] to u nity. If a single one of the conclusions drawn from it proves wrong, it must be given up ; to modify it without destroying the whole structure seems to be impossible.
If a stone is dropped from the top of a tower its mo- tion is by no means uniform; the velocity increases as the stone falls. If a system of co-ordinates K is chosen so that, in re? If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic field,the force acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is present at the locality of the charge, and which we ascertain by transformation of the field to a system of co-ordinates at rest relatively to the electrical charge.
If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic field,there acts upon it, in addition to the electric force, an Oelectromotive forceO which, if we neglect the terms multiplied by the second and higher powers of v/c, is equal to the vector-product of the velocity of the charge and the magnetic force, divided by the velocity of light. If a visitor should come to this country from another planet, would he not . If a wire forming a closed circuit is placed in the vicinity, then again the changing magnetic field will be accompanied by an electric current in the circuit. If a young man bas trained bis muscles and pbysical endurance by gymnastics and walking, be will later be fitted far every pbysical work.
If all the quantities a,,^ are multiplied bv C, the resulting matrix will be denoted by CA. If an arbitrary small ?EE is given, one can always choose V so large that ?s becomes a very large number. If an electric resonator of eigenfrequency and negligible damping occupies the cavity, the time average of the resonator's energy E as a function of () can be calculated from the electromagnetic theory of radiation. If an electron moves from rest at the origin of co-ordinates of the system K along the axis of X under the action of an electrostatic force X, it is clear that the energy withdrawn from the electrostatic field has the value.
If an event takes place anywhere we can assign to it three coordinates, x?, and a time t, as soon as we have specified the time of the clock at the origin which is simultaneous with the event. If an external force (four-dimensional vector, K) acts upon the matter, by the principles of momentum and energy the equation = T? If an individual enjoys well-ordered thoughts, it is quite possible that this side of his nature may grow more pronounced at the cost of other sides and thus, may determine his mentality in increasing degree. If an intellectual association of standing, such as I have described, could be formed, it would no doubt have to try to mobilize the religious organizations for the fight against war.
If an object is defined with respect to every system of Cartesian co-ordinates in a space of reference of n dimensions by the n?numbers A?? If an observer be stationed at A with a clock, he can estimate the time of events occurring in the immediate neighbourhood of A, by looking for the position of the hands of the clock, which are syrchronous with the event. If an observer be stationed at B with a clock,we should add that the clock is of the same nature as the one at A,he can estimate the time of events occurring about B. If an observer sitting in the position M1 in the train did not possess this velocity, then he would remain permanently at M, and the light rays emitted by the flashes of lightning A and B would reach him simultaneously, i.e.
If anything in the theory as sketched N apart from the demand of the invariance of the equations un- der the group of the continuous co- ordinate-transformations N c a n pos- sibly make the claim to final significance, then it is the theory of the limiting case of the pure gravita- tional field and its relation to the metric structure of space. If at A, there be two synchronous clocks, and if we set in motion one of them with a constant velocity along a closed curve till it comes back to A, the journey being completed in /^-seconds, then after arrival, the last men- tioned clock will be behind the stationary one by \t ~ seconds.
If at any moment three squares meet at a corner, then two sides of the fourth square are already laid, and, as a consequence, the arrangement of the remaining two sides of the square is already completely determined. If at the ends P and G of a length PG two equal and parallel lengths PP' and GG' are marked off, P'G' is in general neither equal nor paral- lel to PG. If at the point A of space there is a clock, an observer at A can determine the time values of events in the immediate proximity of A by finding the positions of the hands which are simultaneous with these events.
If at the points A and B of K there are stationary clocks which, viewed in the stationary system, are synchronous; and if the clock at A is moved with the velocity v along the line AB to B, then on its arrival at B the two clocks no longer synchronize, but the clock moved from A to B lags behind the other which has remained at B by (up to magnitudes of fourth and higher order), t being the time occupied in the journey from A to B. If at this space-time point u o, then we have at once for this point the equa- tions (^), (S) (F) of 7. If ayoung man has trained his muscles and phys?
If besides the pure gravitational field other field variables are also present, the field equations of gravitation are ~ik g gi k~ Tiki' where T;k is the "material" energy tensor, ie, that part of the mathematical expression of the energy which does not depend exclusively on the g.In the case of the phenomenological representation of matter if it is to be considered as "dust-like, " that is, without pressure one takes 7'"= p(dx'/ds) (dx"/ds), where p is the density-scalar, dx'/ds the velocity- vector of the matter. If both electric and magnetic poles are at rest, there is no action between them, neither attraction nor re- pulsion. If both vectors have the same initial point, the dotted vector again connects their end- points.
If by chance they do not, a touch of the finger on the metal rod will bring them together. If by the transformation, the expression is changed to ' 21,, '2 I ^ '2 ij,' 2 we must have A A = l. 34 PRINCIPLE OF JIELATIVITY A has to correspond to the following relation, if trans- formation (38) is to be a Lorentz-transforniation. If corpuscles fall on the surface of glass, for example, it may be that a force is exerted on them by the particles of the matter, a force which strangely enough acts only in the immediate neighbourhood of matter. If definite masses of water and alcohol, each at a definite temperature, are mixed together, a knowledge of the specific heats will lead to a prediction of the final temperature of the mixture.
If det A { o, then corresponding* to A there is a reciprocal matrix, which we mav denote bv A"^ so that A~^A= 1 I A matrix I / . If drawn properly, they tell us the direction of the force vector representing the action of the current on a given posi- tive magnetic pole as well as something about the length of this vector. If ds does not vanish along the geodetic line we may choose the "length of the are " s, rr:easured along the geodetic line, for the parameter X. If ds"^ belonging to the element (^Xj dX^fdX^, ff'^i) he positive we call it with Minkowski, time-like, and in the contrary ease space-like.
If each energy quantum of the incident light, independently of everything else, delivers its energy of electrons, then the velocity distribution of the ejected electrons will be independent of the intensity of the incident light; on the other hand the number of electrons leaving the body will, if other conditions are kept constant, be proportional to the intensity of the incident light.7 Remarks similar to those made concerning hypothetical deviations from StokesOs Rule can be made with regard to hypothetical boundaries of validity of the law set forth above. If enough people are ready to take this grave step they will be successful. If ether does not disturb matter in its motion, there can be no interaction between particles of ether and particles of matter.
If every absorbed light energy quantum ionizes a molecule, the following relation must obtain between the quantity of absorbed light L and the number of gram molecules of ionized gas j: j = L/R??. If every ray of light is propagated relative to the embankment with the velocity c, then for this reason it would appear that another law of propagation of light must necessarily hold with respect to the carriage N a result contradictory to the principle of relativity. If everything has really gone smoothly, then I say that the points of the marble slab constitute a Euclidean continuum with respect to the little rod, which has been used as a " distance " (line-interval). If for .t;', we substitute its value xtv, we obtain r}=4> (v) y where S= .
If for example, C'* is any four-vector, then owing to the tensor character of A B*' , the inner product A C'^ B is a scalar, both the four- vectors C and B being arbitrarily chosen. If for the sake of shortness, r is written for the vector with the components {x, y, z) in the first system of reference, r' for the same vector with the components (x' y' z) in the second system of reference, then for the direction of Vy we have and for the perpendicular direction i"), (11) r^= r^ and further (12) \!
If for the sake of simplicity, we keep the null-point of time and space fixed, then the first named group of mechanics signifies that at f o we can give the ,', y, and ^-axes any possible rotation about the null-point corresponding to the homogeneous linear transformation of the expression ^2+^2_^ ^2 The second group denotes that without changing the expression for the mechanical laws, we can substitute {x atyyptj zyt^ for (', y, z) where (a, ^, y) are any constants. If four cars diverge with equal speed from a traffic roundabout, their velocities can be represented by four vectors of the same length, as seen from our last drawing.
If four space-points, which do not lie in one plane are conceived to be at the same time to, then it is no longer per- missible to make a change of the time parameter by a Lorentz transformation, without at the same time destroying the character of the simultaneity of these four space points. If further p and the vectors w', e' , in, in the system {xy'z) are so defined that, 12 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY further (14) (/ + m')^= ^^ + ''"'^-i^^^ + "'^K Vl q" (15) {e' 4- iffi'') = (^ + ^'^^) i [u, {e + ini)] ^ .

If he accepts the premise of war, he must reconcile himself to the maintenance of troops in strategie areas like Austria and Korea; to the sending of troops to Greece and Bulgaria; to the accumula? If he is ingenious he may form some picture of a mechanism which could be responsible for all the things he ob- serves, but he may never be quite sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations. If he makes an honest attempt in this direction without being crushed and trampled under foot by his contemporaries, he may consider himself and the community to which he belongs lucky.
If he releases a body which he previously had in his land, the accelertion of the chest will no longer be transmitted to this body, and for this reason the body will approach the floor of the chest with an accelerated relative motion. If heat is a substance at all, it is a weightless one. If heat may be regarded as a form of energy, perhaps the sum of all three heat, kinetic and potential energies remains constant. If however {g) remains po.-itive and finite, it is clear that the choice of co-ordinatts can be so made that this quantity becomes equal to one. If in (23), the point ( " ^ z I) be su})p>sed to be fixed, the point (:^^ j/^ z^ t^) be supposed to be variable, then the relation (:Zo) would represent the locus of all the space- time points B"^, which are light-points of B.
If in Eq (8) (with m=0) one replaces r by the variable u according to the equation u'= r' e'/2 one obtains SUMMARY AND GENERAL REMARKS. If in a liquid in motion there is present a velocity with a rightward direction increasing from left to right, the individual particle of liquid is bound to undergo acceleration on its journey from left to right.
If in addition to the systems K and k figuring in 3 we introduce still another system of co-ordinates k0 moving parallel to k, its initial point moving on the axis of X with the velocity w, we obtain equations between the quantities x, y, z, t and the corresponding quantities of k0, which differ from the equations found in 3 only in that the place of OvO is taken by the quantity v + w ; 1 + vw/c2 from which we see that such parallel transformationsNnecessarilyNforma group.
If in addition to the systems K, and k, we intro- duce the system k', of which the initial point moves parallel to the ^-axis with velocity 2v, then between the magnitudes, x, y^ z, t and the corresponding magnitudes of k', we obtain a system of equations, which differ from the equations in 3, only in the respect that in place of V, we shall have to write, (.+. If in particular the vector v of the special Lorentz- transformation be equal to the velecity vector u of matter at the space-time point {x^, x^, ;3, x^) then it follows out of (10), (11), (12) that Under these' circumstances therefore, the corresponding space-time point has the velocity v' = after the trans- formation, it is as if we transform to rest.
If in that space I assume a vector-field or an anti-symmetrical tensor- field which can be inferred from it, and ask what are the simplest laws which such a field can satisfy, I arrive at Clerk Maxwells equations for empty space. If in the equations, we conceive E and M and not E-(U. M), and M+ [U E] as electric and magnetie forces, and with a glance to this we substitute for E, M, E, M, div. If in the equations, we conceive E and M and not E-(U. M), and M+ as electric and magnetie forces, and with a glance to this we substitute for E, M, E, M, div. If in the expression for the 4-vector of force per unit volume, K =?? If in the following I shall express my views somewhat dogmatically, I do it only for the sake of clarity and simplicity.
If in the right-hand side of the equation of transformation A'? If in this I adopt a Riemannianmetric, and look for the simplest laws which such a metric can satisfy, I arrive at the relativistic gravitation-theory of empty space. If in what follows I write as if I were clear about certain things and sure of the truth of what I am saying, this is done merely for the sake of an easier mode of expression; it does not proceed from unwarranted self-confidence or a belief in the infallibility of my somewhat simple intellectual conception of problems which are in reality uncommonly complex.
If in what follows I write as if I were sure of the truth of what I am saying, this is merely clone for the sake of an easier mode of expression; it does not proceed from unwarranted self-confidence or a belief in the infallibility of my somewhat simple intellectual conception of problems which are in reality uncommonly complex. If incandescent sodium is placed before the prism, we see only one yellow line. If instead of " body of reference " we insert " system of co-ordinates," which is a useful idea for mathematical description, we are in a position to say : The stone traverses a straight line relative to a system of coordinates rigidly attached to the carriage, but relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the ground (embankment) it describes a parabola.
If instead of Newton's law we insert a somewhat different law of attraction into the calculation, we find that, according to this new law, the motion would still take place in such a manner that the distance sun-planet exhibits periodic variations; but in this case the angle described by the line joining sun and planet during such a period (from perihelionNclosest proximity to the sunNto perihelion) would differ from 3600.
If instead of integrating over the normal section, we integrate the equations over that cross section of the fila- ment which is normal to the / axis, and passes through {(\y,z,t), then the equations (22) are obtained, but dr are now multiplied by ; in particular, the last equa- tion comes out in the form, dt \ dr / dt dt dt The right side is to be looked upon as the amount of work done per unit of time at the material point. If it * Note A. XVlll PEIXCIPLE OF EELATIYITY is found simpler to refer all motion in a gravitational field to a special set of co-ordinates, we may certainly look upon this special ^'framework" (at least for the particular region concerned), to be more fundamental and more natural. If it did not fit, another hypothesis had to be devised and again tested.
If it is necessary for the purpose of describing nature, to make use of a co-ordinate system arbitrarily introduced by us, then the choice of its state of motion ought to be subject to no restriction ; the laws ought to be entirely independent of this choice (general principle of relativity). If it is necessary to modify the theory's elements, couldn't one keep the propagation laws intact, and only change the conceptions of the elementary processes of emission and absorption? If it is one of the goals of religion to liberate mankind as far as possible from the bondage of egocentric cravings, de? If it is our aim to describe everything that ever happened or may happen with the help of one theory, then the union of optics and electricity is, undoubtedly, a very great step forward.
If it is really true that a radiative resonator can only assume energy values that are multiples of h, the obvious assumption is that the emission and absorption of light occurs only in these energy quantities. If it is simply a question of detecting or of describing the motion involved, it is in principle immaterial to what reference-body we refer the motion. If it is true that no absolute signifi- cance can be attached to uniform motion from the physical point of view, the question arises whether this statement must not also be extended to non-uniform motions. If it moves on the spherical surface away from S upwards, the disc shadow L' on the plane also moves away from S on the plane outwards, growing bigger and bigger.
If it were not the electron, the smallest possible charge, but some respectable charge containing billions of electrons, we could disregard the whole quantum theory and treat the problem according to our old pre-quantum physics. If it were not, then one specific inertial system or more accurately, one sp.e? If it were really a scientifc matter, one would probably be tempted to silence by such considerations. If it were really a scientific matter, one would probably be tempted to silence by such con? If it were true that the earth attracts all bodies with the same force, that of greatest inertial mass would move more slowly in falling than any other.
If its radius, measured at rest with a unit measuring rod is equal to Ro, its radius R in motion, might be different from Ro, since the theory of relativity does not make the assumption that the shape of bodies with respect to a space of reference is independent of their motion relatively to this space of reference. If l,m,n are the direction-cosines of the wave-normals of the light in the stationary system, no energy passes through the surface elements of a spherical surface moving with the velocity of light:N (x ? If language is to lead at all to understanding, there must be rules con?
If language is to lead at all to understanding, there must be rules concerning the relations between the signs on the one hand and on the other hand there must be a stable correspondence between signs and impressions. If many such singularities are separated by a distance small with respect to the dimensions of the field of one singular point, their fields will be superimposed, and will form in their totality an oscillating field that is only slightly different from the oscillating field in our present electromagnetic theory of light. If men as individuals surrender to the call of their elementary instincts, avoiding pain and seeking satisfaction only for tbeir own selves, the result for them all taken together must be a state of inse?
If my room travelled, relative to the ether-sea, with the velocity of light, then the light emitted from the centre of the room would never reach the wall running away with the velocity of light. If n be the direction perpendicular to the direction of propa<jjation, we have, from Huygen's principle, that light-rays (taken in the plane (y, >?)] If n is a direction perpendicular to the propagation of light, the Huyghens principle shows that the light-ray, en? If no attraction results, we must turn the magnet and try the other end. If not, then the intellectuals of this country de? If not, what precisely is the relation between our knowledge and the raw material furnished by sense-impressions? If nothing spurs him on, then he will hardly think, and will behave from habit like an automaton.
If now gravitation is the cause of the acceleration, we then have (Force) = (gravitational mass) x (intensity of the gravitational field), where the "gravitational mass" is likewise a characteristic constant for the body. If now in the above-mentioned rotation round the Z-axis, we replace 1, 2, 3, 4 throughout by 3, 4, 1^ 2, and <f> by i^, we at once perceive that simultaneously, new magnitudes p\, p'2, p 3, p' 4, where {p\=Pi, P2=P2^ P3=P3 cos ii}/ + P4 sin iif/, p\ = Pg sin t\l/ + P4 cos iij/), and/ 12 /34. If now instead of {x, y, z, it), I use the method of writing with indices, certain essential circumstances will come into evidence ; on this will be based a general use of the suffixes (1, 2, 3, ^).
If now m^ denote the mass of the sun, a the semi major axis of the earth's orbit, then this factor amounts to 10~. If now s is selected as the .r-direetion, /\,s' is then a three-dimensional parallelepiped with the sides (I//j dz, (IJ, then we have DiY /,= i \dz. If now the quantity 8 is measured and is found to have the value bwe conclude that after the measurement the first system is left in the state given by v(x() and the second system is left in the state given by (.
If now we seek the mechanics of a bodily object which itself can not be treated as a materia!point-and strictly speaking every object "perceptible to our senses" is of this category-then the question arises: How shall we imagine the object to be built up out of materia!points, and what forces must we assume as acting between them? If on the other hand, we take the 16 products A of the components of two co.variant four-vectors A and B , V (10) A =A B . If one Iooks at the substance rather than at the form, then one can take these words as expressing also the fundamental democratic position. If one calculates from this the (fictitious) energy tensor T;k one obtains as nonvanishing com- ponents Tpi T2g n'/o /(1+ n'x P/o )'.
If one compares this with Newton's system, the change con- sists in this: action at a distance is also describes the radiation. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conHict between them appears im-a possible. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impos? If one conductor is connected to the free copper plate and another to the zinc, both will become charged, the first positively and the other negatively. If one considers these two systems as a single system of entropy S and probability W, it follows that S = S1 + S2 = ? If one considers this done, then only "dimension-less" constants could occur in the basic equations of phys- ics.
If one denotes by J the (theoretical) work of ionization per gram equivalent, then it follows that: R ? If one did not wish to forego a physical inter- pretation of the coordinates in gen- eral (something which, in itself, would be possible), it was better to permit such inconsistency N with the obligation, however, of eliminating it at a later stage of the tiieory. If one does not make this obvious assumption, one obtains, in place of the last equation: ?E + P0 2 R??. If one had stopped with the special theory of relativity, i.e., with the invariance under the Lorentz-group, then the field-law R.j^ N o would remain invar- iant also within the frame of this narrower group.
If one holds these high principles clearly before one's eyes, and compares them with the Iife and spirit of our times, then it appears glaringly that civilized mankind finds itself at pres? If one holds these high principles clearly before one's eyes, and compares tl1em with tl1e !ife and spirit of our times, tl1en it appears glaringly that civilized mankind finds itself at pres? If one intmduces in place of r a new variable accoldlng to thc equation one obtains for ds~ the expression ds' = 4(N'+ 2m) du' u' (u'+2m)'(d0'+sin"-ed'')+ dI'. If one introduces in this space the new coordinates Xi. If one is asked for his opinion, he is inclined to answer no.
If one looks at the substance rather than at the form, then one can take these words as expressing also the fundamental dernocratic position. If one modifies the equations in an unessential manner so as to make them free from denominators, regular solutigns can be obtained, provided one treats the physical space as consist- ing of two congruent sheets. If one neglects unity in comparison with es one obtains the results of the classical theory; from the following it will soon become clear under which conditions this neglect is justified. If one observes that the local dX? If one of our assumptions about the momenta were to be changed, a violation of eq.
If one of the elective bodies above specified is dissatisfied with a resolution of the Council, it may repiace its representative by another. If one puts this Tik into the gravitational Eqs. If one reads Hume's books, one is amazed that many and sometimes even highly esteemed philosophers after him have been able to write so much obscure stuff and even find grateful readers for it. If one solves the equations of the general theory of relativity for the static spherically symmetric case, with or without an electrostatic field, one finds that singularities occur in the solutions. If one then tried to employ the known methods of classical mechanics for calculating the final positions of the particles, the difficulties would be insurmountable.
If one tries to interpret the regular solution (Sa) in the space of r, 0, @, t, one arrives at the follow- ing conclusion. If one views this phase of the development of theory critically, one is struck by the dualism which lies in the fact that the material point in Newton's sense and the field as continuum are used as elementary concepts side by side. If one were to take that goal out of its religious form and look merely at its purely human side, one might state it perhaps thus: free and re? If one wishes to escape from this diffculty he must found the theory upon field and field laws instead of upon forces of interaction.
If only one single point of mass were present, according to this view, it would possess inertia, and in fact an inertia almost as great as when it is surrounded by the other masses of the actual universe. If other co-ordinates are introduced by means of a non-linear transformation, ds^ remains a homoge- neous function of the differentials of the co-ordinates, but the co-efficients of this function (g/xv) cease to be constant and become certain functions of the co- ordinates. If our assumption is correct, then the velocity of light in the direction of the motion of the earth should differ from the velocity of light in an opposite direction.
If our conception is correct, this relationship must be valid for all gases which (at the relevant frequency) show no appreciable absorption without ionization. If our imaginary lift were to reach from the North Pole to the Equator, with the handkerchief placed over the North Pole and the watch over the Equator, then, for the outside observer, the two bodies would not have the same acceleration; they would not be at rest relative to each other. If our rotating observer could not con- firm the laws of mechanics, w^- on our earth, should also be unable to do so. If our speed were greater than that of light, we should be able to run away from a light signal.
If our statistical laws tell us that one-third of the particles have a speed between 1000 and uoo feet per second, it means that by repeating our observations for many particles, we shall really obtain this average, or in other words, that the probability of finding a particle within this limit is equal to one-third. If p is the density of charge, we have, when = 1, /;. If p0 be the uniform ensity of a distribution of mass, then 47r1, </> = - T Po (3) is a solution of equation (2). If preferred, a violin string may be used. If primary cathode rays impinge on a metal plate P1, they produce X-rays. If r ^ 's vanish, the point moves uniformly and in a fJLV straight line ; these magnitudes therefore determine the deviation from uniformity.
If r is the measured distance between the two points, then the propagation of light must satisfy the equation r = c.t If we square this equation, and express r2 by the differences of the co-ordinates, x? If referred to the system K1, the propagation of light takes place according to this equation. If several particles are present, this case corresponds to finding a solution without singularities of the modified Eqs (3a), the solution representing a space with two congruent sheets connected by several discrete "bridges". If so, what are the simplest field laws to which such a continuum can be made subject? If something happens at some point at some time in my c.s., then the observer in another c.s. If such a world government is not established by a process of agree?
If such molecules belong to a gas at temperature T, the relative frequency Wn of such states Zn is given by the formula Wn = pn exp ( - enjkT), (5) which corresponds to the canonical distribution of states in statistical mechanics. If such were not the case it would be quite evident that the situation of such states as are unarmed or only partially equipped for defense would be extremely difficult, dangerous, and disadvantageous a condition which is refuted by the facts. If that happens, this Gumbel case, after an unedifying begin? If that happens, this Gumbel case, after an unedifying beginning, may still do good.
If that is so, we can just as well imagine the ether is at rest relative to K', not K. It is completely unnatural to distinguish the two reference frames K' and K by introducing an ether that is at rest in one. If the 'li'r are normalized," then !cii is nearly equal to 1, !c2 ! If the Galilean relativity principle is valid, then motion through ether makes no sense at all. If the above is really true then, because of the independence of the secondary cathode rays' speed on the primary cathode rays' intensity, we must assume that an electron impinging on P1 will either cause no electrons to be produced at P2, or else a secondary emission of an electron whose speed is of the same order as that of the initial electron impinging on P1.
If the answer is yes, then we can hardly do otherwise than ascribe 3 to this condition a definite energy U , and, in particular, such an energy as exceeds U1 by a small ations of the system, in the quantum mechanics they produce alterations of any magnitude however large, but with corre? If the car is to proceed freely to the end of the course, its height may attain a hundred feet as many times as he likes, but never exceed it. If the cart is initially at rest and then given a push, it afterwards moves uniformly with a certain velocity. If the clock at A as w^ell as the clock at B are both synchronous with the clock at C, then the clocks at A and B are svnchronous. If the clock at B be synchronous with the clock at A, then the clock at A is synchronous with the clock at B.
If the clock is not further interfered with, it may be regarded as a closed system. If the crystal rotates, nothing along the axis changes. If the crystal were not brought between the X-rays and the photographic plate, only the light spot in the centre would be seen. If the curve be- comes a straight line, all the generalized concepts must reduce to the familiar ones describing rectilinear mo- tion. If the cylinder is at rest relatively to K' the equation of its lateral surface is x'2 + y'2 = R02 If we write the last two equations of (29) more generally x'2 =?x2 x'3 =?x3 then the lateral surface of the cylinder referred to K satisfies the equation x2 + y2 = R2 The factor ?
If the density of the suspension is inhomo- geneous, the osmotic pressure is in- homogeneous, too, and gives rise to a compensating diffusion, which can be calculated from the well-known mo- bility of the particles. If the derived formula is correct, then ?, when represented in Cartesian coordinates as a function of the frequency of the incident light, must be a straight line whose slope is independent of the nature of the emitting substance. If the difference in energy of some of the energy levels is sufficiently great, then an ultraviolet photon will be sent out, giving a line beyond the visible spectrum.
If the directions of the two vectors are respectively the directions of the radius vector OR to one of the surfaces -|-F=1, and of a tangent RS APPENDIX ' 81 at the point R of the surface^ then the vectors shall be called normal to each other. If the disc on the sphere K is moved, its shadow L' on the plane E also moves. If the displacement of spectral lines towards the red by the gravitational potential does not exist, then the general theory of relativity will be untenable. If the distance were a mile, he would have had to detect time intervals of the order of one hundred-thousandth of a second !
If the earth is movino- through the ether there is a river of ether flowing- throuopli the laboratory, and a wave of light may be compared to a swnmmer travelling with constant velocity relative to the current. If the economic situation cannot be cleared up without systematic regulation, how much more necessary is such regulation for dealing with the problems of international politics! If the electric masses are free, that is, under the sole influence of the electromagnetic field, the covariant vector Ku will vanish. If the electrical masses be free, that is, under the influence of the eleetro- maofnetic field only, then the covariant four-vector K will vanish.
If the electron be at rest at any definite epoch, then in the next "particle of time,^^ the motion takes place according to the equations df" dt^ df" Where (.r, ^, z) are the co-ordinates of the electron, and m is its mass. If the electron moves from the origin of co-or- dinates of the system K with the initial velocity steadily along the X-axis under the action of an electromotive force X, then it is clear that the energy drawn from the electrostatic field has the value SelLd>\ Since the electron is only slowly accelerated, and in consequence, no energy is given out in the form of radiation, therefore the energy drawn from the electro-static field may be put equal to the energy W of motion. If the energy transfer is negative, then the force acts on the resonator in the opposite direction.
If the entropy of monochromatic radiation depends on volume as though the radiation were a discontinuous medium consisting of energy quanta of magnitude R? If the existence of such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a fundamental impossibility in physicsif, in fact, nothing else whatever were observable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in time, we should have no ground for the assumption that water consists of movable particles. If the experiments had been performed with a glass rod rubbed with cat's fur we should have had to call the excess positive, to conform with the accepted conven- tion.
If the fluorescent substance is not a perpetual source of energy, the principle of conservation of energy requires that the energy of an emitted energy quantum cannot be greater than that of the incident light quantum; it follows that R ? If the gravitational forces are weak, Newton's law turns out to be a good approximation to the new laws. If the holes are close together and very (Photographed by V. Arkadiev) Above, we see a photograph of light spots after two beams have passed through two pin holes, one after the other. If the idea of physical reality had ceased to be purely atomic, it still remained for the time being purely mechanistic; people still tried to explain all events as the motion of ine*1: masses ; indeed no other way of looking at things seemed conceivable.
If the incident radiation bundle produces the transition Zn-^~Zm by absorption of radiation, a momentum {emBn)lc is transferred to the molecule in the direction of propagation of the beam. If the inertial principle is invalid, then the body is in non-uniform motion. If the inertial principle is valid in one case, it is not valid in the other. If the integrals of the right side be K^. If the kinetic energy of the mass point is below a certain limit, then the mass point, according to classica! If the latter is isotropic, we shall have to assume that all directions of emission are equally probable. If the law of rectilinear motion were still valid, the path would be that shown by the dotted line.
If the laws of configuration of ideal rigid bodies are to be expressed geometrically, then in the presence of a gravitational field the geometry is not Euclidean. If the liquid is made to rotate by a spoon, the leaves will soon collect in the center of the bottom of the cup. If the molecular -kinetic theory is essentially correct, a suspension of visible particles must possess the same kind of osmotic pressure fulfilling the laws of gases as a solution of mole- cules. If the molecular picture were extended to deal with every single unit, the calculation of the integral B would offer such difficulties that an exact- calculation of F could be SCarceIy contem- plated.
If the molecule is acted upon by several directional radiation bundles, then it is always only a single one of these which participates in an elementary process of irradiation; this bundle alone then determines the direction of the momentum transferred to the molecule. If the molecule undergoes a loss in energy of magnitude hv without external excitation, by emitting this energy in the form of radiation (outgoing radiation), then this process, too, is directional. If the motion and propagation are along the same axis and have the same sense, the Vabs is simply the sum of the two speeds Vabs = V + v This is a consequence of assuming that the ether participates in the motion of its object.
If the motion of the carriage is now changed into a non-uniform motion, as for instance by a powerful application of the brakes, then the occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful jerk forwards. If the movement discussed here can actually be observed (together with the laws relating to it that one would expect to find), then classical thermodynamics can no longer be looked upon as applicable with precision to bodies even of dimensions distinguishable in a microscope : an exact determination of actual atomic dimensions is #en possible. If the net force on the light-corpuscles is an attraction perpendicular to the surface of the glass, the new motion will lie somewhere between the line of the original path and the perpendicular.
If the object, when moved, takes its ether along with it, the light will propagate in the same way as when the object was at rest. If the observer applies his standard measuring-rod (a rod which is short as compared with the radius of the disc) tangentially to the edge of the disc, then, as judged from the Galileian system, the length of this rod will be less than I, since, according to Section 12, moving bodies suffer a shortening in the direction of the motion. If the observer perceives the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous. If the observer pushes a body in any direction, up or down for instance, it always moves uniformly so long as it does not collide with the ceiling or the floor of the lift.
If the os- cillating charge suddenly ceases to move, then its field becomes electrostatic. If the photon behaves like a corpuscle in classical physics, it must pass through one of the two holes. If the piston is ini- tially at rest in some position, it can be moved upward by removing and downward by adding weight. If the planets moved uniformly in a circle around the sun, it would have been comparatively easy to discover how these movements must look from the earth. If the plate is at rest, the pressures are equal. If the plate is moved, however, the pressure on the forward side pushing back is greater than its counterpart pushing in the opposite direction.
If the pole is moved farther in the same direction a repulsion is observed, attaining its greatest strength at the second pole of the hanging magnet. If the principle of relativity (in the restricted sense) does not hold, then the Galileian co-ordinate systems K, K1, K2, etc., which are moving uniformly relative to each other, will not be equivalent for the description of natural phenomena. If the principle of relativity were not valid we should therefore expect that the direction of motion of the earth at any moment would enter into the laws of nature, and also that physical systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the orientation in space with respect to the earth.
If the prism moves with a velocity n with respect to this fixed ether, then the incident velocity of light with respect to the prism should be c + n. ThuE the refractive index of the glass prism should depend on m the absolute velocity of the prism, i.e., its velocity witl respect to the fixed ether. If the quantity of electricity is at rest relatively to the moving system (at least at the relevant instant), then the force acting upon it, measured in the moving system, is equal to the vector (X0, Y0, Z0). If the quantum hypothesis holds, we can obviously interpret the process in the following way. If the radiation energy of frequency ?
If the reader has followed all our previous considerations, he will have no further difficulty in understanding the methods leading to the solution of the problem of gravitation. If the real transformations 4) are t^en, and ^' y' z' t' be takes as a new frame of reference, then we shall have (5) qu^ +1 p =p \ , P^^r -p \ ^ZIZZIIl p'uj=pu^, p'uy'=pUy. If the results are inserted in eq. If the results of physics and astronomy are to maintain their clearness, the physical meaning of specifications of position must always be sought in accordance with the above considerations.
If the rigid platform carrying the gap is set in motion with respect to the ether in the direc- tion of light propagation;, light waves (which are even now situated in free ether) should presumably take a longer time to cross the gap. If the roles of the horizontal rows and vertical columns be intercharged, we obtain a qxp series matrix, which TYPICAL KEPKESENTATIO]S^S 31 will be kuoAvn as the traDsposed matrix of A, and will be denoted by A. If the room is closed, the air inside is forced to move with it. If the room travelled with a velocity smaller than that of light, then a wave sent from the centre of the room would reach one of the walls before the other. If the scbool succeeds in working suc?
If the school succeeds in working successfully from sucb points of view, it will be bighly bonored by the rising generation and tbe tasks given by the scbool will be submitted to as a son of gif t. I bave known children wbo preferred school? If the second goal, that is, the possibility of the spiritual development of all individuals, is to be secured, a second kind of outward freedom is necessary. If the six-vector be of a special type, i.e., a piece of plane, then this vector of the third type denotes the parallelopiped formed of this four-vector and the comple- ment of this piece of plane. If the socio-economie problem is considered objectively, it appears as follows: technological development has led to increasing centralization of the economie mechanism.
If the space volumes of the filament referred to the two systems are dV and dV0 respectively, then we have o?0dVdl = o? If the space-time vector of the 2nd kind is not singular, we rotate the spacial co-ordinate system in such a manner that the vector-product \jne] coincides with the Z-axis, i.e. If the speed of a body is equal to that of light relative to a ship, then it will also be equal to that of light relative to the shore. If the speedo- meters of two cars both show forty miles per hour, it is usual to say that they have the same speed or velocity, no matter in which direction they are travelling. If the sun (S) were not present, a star which is practically infinitely distant would be seen in the direction D1, as observed front the earth.
If the sur- face of the water in a swimming pool, forming one of the co-ordinate systems, is horizontal, then in the other the surface of the water in a similar swimming pool takes the curved form similar to anyone who stirs his coffee with a spoon. If the suspended particles have spherical form (radius of the sphere = P), and if the liquid has a coefficient of viscosity k, then the force K im- parts to the single particles a velocity (*) and there will pass a unit area per unit of time vK 67rkP particles. If the theory corresponds to the facts, radiation conveys inertia between the emitting and absorbing bodies. If the theory did not accomplish this or could not do it naturally, it was to be rejected.
If the three components of a vector vanish for one system of Cartesian co-ordinates, they vanish for all systems, because the equations of transformation are homogeneous. If the time axis is chosen in such a way that it has the direction of the line differential which we are considering, or, in other terms, if we transform the material particle to rest, we shall have d? If the two con- ductors are brought together or connected by a wire, it follows from the theory of electric fluids that they will show no charge and thus no difference of electric poten- tial at all. If the two pieces have the same specific heat at the new temperature, the whole substance theory must break down. If the universe is Euclidean, then F = 4!R2 ; if it is spherical, then F is always less than 4!R2.
If the velocity is great, extremely strong forces are required to increase it. If the velocity is known for all points along the curve, the direction of the force at any point can be deduced at once. If the velocity is no indication of the ex- ternal forces acting on a body, what is? If the velocity of light is the same in all c.s., if the relativity theory is valid, then we must sacrifice this assumption. If the velocity of the ship is thirty miles per hour relative to the shore, and if the uniform velocities of man and ship both have the same direction, then the velocity of the stroller will be thirty-three miles per hour relative to an observer on the shore, or three miles per hour relative to the ship.
If the water in one of the cylinders is now nriade to fiow^, the " condensed" ether within the flowing water wonld be conveeted and would produce a shift in the interference fringes. If the water which was previously at rest were suddenly set in motion by the action of an evenly diffused accelerating force, the distribution of velocities over the cross section would be even at first. If the waves are small enough and the ship large enough, a very distinct shadow appears. If the wire is connected to the copper plate but not to the zinc, there will exist a potential difference but no current can flow.
If then it is the case that the axiomatic basis of theoretical physics cannot be an inference from experience, but must be free invention, have we any right to hope that we shall find the correctway? If then one conceives of the be- havior of a body, in reference to the latter reference system, as caused by a **rear' (not merely apparent) gravitational field, it is possible to regard this reference system as an "inertial system" with as much justi- fication as the original reference sys- tem. If then the wave function provided such a complete description of reality, it would contain these values; these would then be predictable.
If then we can build upon Maxwell's equations at all, the energy tensor of the electromagnetic field is known only outside the charged particles.13 In these regions, outside of charged particles, the only regions in which we can believe that we have the complete expression for the energy tensor, we have, by (47), T? If then we replace (3) by R *=g'RI,) 0, (3a) this system of equations is satisfied by (1) at all finite points. If there are many elementary entities, then their (microscopic) distribution, which governs the thermodynamics, is characterized by the manner in which the entities are distributed over these cells.
If there be also a local system of the above kind given for the case under consi- deration, dX's would then be represented by definite linear homogeneous expressions of the form (2) dX =^ a dx V / V (T vcr (T If we substitute the expression in (1) we get (3) ds''='^ g d.v d.v where a will be functions of .c, but will no longer depend (TT upon the orientation and motion of the 'local' co-ordinates; for ds^ is a definite magnitude belonging to two point- events infinitely near in space and time and can be got by 100 PEIXCIPLE OP HELATIVITY measurements with rods and clocks. If there is a definite gap in a rigid body, light waves situated in free ether will take a delinite time in crossing the gap. If there is any change of axes, the numerical magnitude of the movements will also chano'e.
If there is any truth in de Broglie's idea, then there must be some phenomena in which matter reveals its wave-like character. If there is anything that can give a layman in the sphere of economics the courage to express an opinion on the nature of the alarming economie difficulties of the present day, it is the hopeless confusion of opinions among the experts. If there is at the point B of space another clock in all respects resembling the one at A, it is possible for an observer at B to determine the time values of events in the immediate neighbourhood of B. If there is some truth in our analogy, a still simpler arrangement than that of the atom should correspond to a spreading wave.
If there were in the nature of the case no such floating bodies to aid us in tracing the movement of the particles of liquid, if nothing at all could be observed in the whole procedure except the fleeting changes in the position of the space occu- pied by the water, we should have no ground for supposing that the water consists of particles. If there were no air or other material medium between the mouth and the ear, we could not detect a sound. If these X-rays impinge on a second metal plate P2, cathode rays are again produced whose speed is of the same order as that of the primary cathode rays. If these are abandoned, the essence of Lorentz's theory or, more generally, the "constancy of the speed of light" principle can be reconciled with the relativity principle.
If these beings say their universe is " plane," there is sense in the statement, because they mean that they can perform the constructions of plane Euclidean geometry with their rods. If these concepts are assumed, together with their relation to the solid bodies of experience, then it is easy to say what we mean by the three-dimensionality of space; to each point three numbers, x1, x2, x3 (co-ordinates), may be associated, in such a way that this association is uniquely reciprocal, and that x1, x2 and x3 vary continuously when the point describes a continuous series of points (a line). If these equations which hold in the system K, are transformed to the system k with the aid of the transfor- mation-equations given in 3 and 6, then we obtain the equations : where Uc.
If they are equal of their own accord, then this is an especial favour of the marble slab and of the little rods, about which I can only be thankfully surprised. If they were not acceptable, they could at least bave served as a basis of discussion for a real solution of the problems of international security. If they wish to avoid the degrading slavery of war-service, they must declare with no uncertain voice for complete disarmament. If thi latter velocity changes owing to a change in the medium filling the telescope, aberration itself should change, thai is, aberration should depend on the nature of the medium. If this can be done, our difficulties will be over.
If this construction is made on a plane surface, we have an uninterrupted disposition in which there are six discs touching every disc except those which lie on the outside. If this conviction had not been a strongly emotional one and if those searching far knowl? If this current of air moves with velocity //, along the r-axis, an electromotive force would be set up along the c;-axib, due to the relative mutioji of matter and magnetic tubes of induction. If this experiment be carried out with a measuring rod at rest relatively to the Galiliean system K we would get TT, as the quotient. If this experiment were performed with a measuring-rod atarest relatively to the Galilean system K , the quotient would be 71'.
If this is done, the special characteristics of our framework would naturally depend on the actual distribution of matter in the field. If this is really so, then there must exist some connection between the optical and electrical properties of matter that can be deduced from the theory. If this is right, there must be here and in all other similar physical processes a definite rate of exchange between the two. If this is so, classical mechanics must change in order to conform with the demand of invariance with respect to the Lorentz transformation. If this is so, the analogy between light and sound is perfect. If this is so, then the Galilean relativity principle is not valid and the speed of light cannot be the same in every c.s.
If this law were not valid for real clocks, the proper frequencies for the separate atoms of the same chemical element would not be in such exact agreement as experience demonstrates. If this natural law did not exist, the man in the accelerated chest would not be able to interpret the behaviour of the bodies around him on the supposition of a gravitational field, and he would not be justified on the grounds of experience in supposing his reference-body to be " at rest." If this point had only a momentary existence without duration, then it would to described in space-time by a single system of values x1, x2, x3, x4.
If this principle held good for any events whatever (the principle of equivalence), this was an indication that the principle of relativity needed to be extended to co-ordinate systems in non-uniform motion with respect to each other, if we were to reach an easy and natural theory of the gravitational fields. If this quantity of electricity be at rest in the stationary system, then the force acting upon it is equivalent to the vector (X, Y, Z) of electric force. If this quantity of electricity is at rest relatively to the stationary system, then by definition the vector (X, Y, Z) is equal to the force acting upon it. If this state- ment were to lose its sense, our argument (p. 32) about foretelling the future path would fail. If this system, as well as the " loca! "
If this were so, it could not make the slightest difference whether or not the other is covered. If this were the case, then, according to the modern doctrines of latent Heat, and of caloric, the capacity ought not only to be changed, but the change undergone by them should be sufficiently great to account for all the Heat produced. If this were the main dillculty that stands in the way of that keen conception, the millenary fate of man would have been incomparably happier than it actu? If through any causeNin our case through radiation processesNit should occur that the energy of an oscillator takes on a time-average value greater or less than E, then the collisions with the free electrons and molecules would lead to a gain or loss of energy by the gas, different on the average from zero.
If thus it appeared that it was possible to get certain knowledge of the objects of experience by means of pure thinking, this "wonder" rested upon an error. If two bodies are of equal value for the filling of one such interval, they will also prove of equal value for the filling of other intervals. If two bodies have the same rest mass, the one with the greater kinetic energy resists the action of an external force more strongly. If two cars pass each other on the highway and their speedometers both show 40 m.p.h., we characterize their velocities by two different vectors with arrows pointing in opposite directions.
If two factories produce the same sort of goods, other things being equal, that one will be able to produce them more cheaply which employs less workmen i.e., makes the individual worker work as long and as hard as human nature permits. If two good clocks observed from the mid-point of the distance between them always show the same time, then they are well suited for designating the time of events at two distant points. If unrestricted sacro egoismo leads to disastrous consequences in economic life, it is a still worse guide in international relations. If w also has the direction of the axis of X, we get . If war is to be averted, it must be done quickly.
If we apply Boltzmann's law of distribution for gas molecules to tbe stars, by comparing the stellar system with a gas in thermal equilibrium, we find that the Newtonian stellPr system cannot exist at ali. If we apply quite similar considerations to light rays which are being transmitted along the negative x-axis, we obtain the condition (x' + ct') = (x + ct) . If we apply the last of equations (43) to a material particle at rest (q = 0), we see that the energy, Eo, of a body at rest is equal to its mass. If we apply to these equations the transformation developed in 3, by referring the electromagnetic processes to the system of co-ordinates there introduced, moving with the velocity v, we obtain the equations , where . If we are given a surface (e.g.
If we are given the Cartesian co-ordinates, xa and the time t, of an event relatively to one inertial system, K, how can we calculate the co-ordinates, x'?and the time, t', of the same event relatively to an inertial system K' which moves with uniform translation relatively to K? If we are to have in the universe an average density of matter which differs from zero, however small may be that difference, then the universe cannot be quasi-Euclidean. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of tension in the rope, the man in the chest will say: "The suspended body experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this is neutralised by the tension of the rope ; what determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the gravitational mass of the suspended body."
If we ask the two observers what results they expect to obtain, their answers would run something like this: The outside observer: My c.s. If we assume for the moment that we have taken into account all the radiation's mechanical influence, we can summarize as follows. If we assume tbat all these parts of space are connected, and therefore that tbe density of electricity differs from zero only in separate " world? If we assume that the result obtained for a polygonal line holds also for a curved line, we obtain the following law.
If we assume that the result proved for a polygonal line is also valid for a continuously curved line, we arrive at this result: If one of two synchronous clocks at A is moved in a closed curve with constant velocity until it returns to A, the journey lasting t seconds, then by the clock which has remained at rest the travelled clock on its arrival at A will be second slow. If we assume the ether to be at rest relatively to K, but in motion relatively to K', the physical equivalence of K and K' seems to me from the logical standpoint, not indeed downright incorrect, but nevertheless inacceptable. If we believe in the simple transformation principle for the velocities of sound waves, we can now apply our con- clusions to light waves as well.
If we briefly call this force as ^^the force acting upon the electron," and maintain the equation : Mass-number x acceleration-number=force-number, and if we further -fix that the accelerations are measured in the stationary system K, then from the above equations, we obtain : Longitudinal mass = m ( V'- %y # Transversal mass = m V^- % Naturally, when other definitions are given of the force and the acceleration, other numlers are obtained for the * Vide Note 21. If we call A1 and B1 the two points on the train whose distance apart is required, then both of these points are moving with the velocity v along the embankment. If we call dr o t^Q ^' natural ^* \o\\xme eleinent ^Xj r/Xg ^Xg d^^ we have thus (18a) ^t.
If we call its mass before emission M and its mass after emission m then, by ignoring terms higher than second order, we can write (1/2) M v2 = (1/2) m v2 + (1/2) L (v2/c2) or M = m + L / c2 Thus, the inertial mass of an object is diminished by the emission of light. If we call the amplitude of the electric or magnetic force A or A0 respectively, accordingly as it is measured in the stationary system or in the moving system, we obtain A which equation, if ? If we call the angle between the wave-normal (direction of the ray) in the moving system and the connecting line Osource-observerO ?0, the equation for l0 assumes the form . If we call the disc-shadows rigid figures, then spherical geometry holds good on the plane E with respect to these rigid figures.
If we call the energy of the body after the emission of light E1 or H1 respectively, measured relatively to the system (x,y,z) or (?,?,?) If we can agree on some fundamental ethical propositions, then other ethical propositions can be derived from them, provided that the originai premises if this kind some ethical premises are tacitly taken for granted. If we choose any new system of co? If we choose instead of the oriijiual co-ordinate svstem I any new one, so would the ^ 's referred to this last system be no Ioniser constants. If we choose the right path we shall succeed and give the rest of the world a fine example. If we choose the system of co-ordinates in agreement with the accompanying diagram, the tota!
If we chose the velocity of light"^ to be the fundamental unit of measurement for all observers (that is, assume the constancy of the velocity of light in all systems) we can establish a metric ^^ oneone ^' correspondence between any two observed systems, such correspondence depending only the relative velocity of the two systems. If we combine two special Lorentz transformations with the relative velocities v1 and v2 , then the velocity of the single Lorentz transformation which takes the place of the two separate ones is, according to (27), given by v12 = i tan(? If we confine ourselves to investigating the dependence of the entropy on the volume occupied by the radiation, and if we denote by S0 the entropy of the radiation at volume v0, we obtain S ?
If we confine the application of the theory to the case where the gravitational fields can be regarded as being weak, and in which all masses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities which are small compared with the velocity of light, we then obtain as a first approximation the Newtonian theory. If we consider a complete system (for example the Solar-system) its total mass, as also its total gravitating action, will depend on the total energy of the system, ponderable as well as gravitational.
If we consider once more the solution (I) from the standpoint of the information we have acquired from the Schwarzschild solution, we see that there also the two congruent halves of the space for xl&0 and xi&0 can be interpreted as two sheets each corresponding to the same physical space. If we consider precisely this movement from any chosen system of co-ordinates K1, the body, observed from K1, moves, according to the considerations in 2, in a gravitatonal feld. If we consider the gravitational field and the electro-magnetic field from the standpoint of the ether hypothesis, we find a notable fundamental dif- ference between the two.
If we consider the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field from the standpoint of the ether hypothesis, we find a remarkable difference between the two. If we consider the invariant of the vector A?, that is, the square of its magnitude, g?A A ? If we consider, for example, equations (19a) only from the standpoint of relativity of direction, as we have done above, we see that they have three logically independent terms. If we could somehow manage to prevent the purchasing-power of the masses, measured in terms of goods, from sinking below a certain minimum, stoppages in the industrial cycle such as we are experiencing to-day would be rendered impossible. If we could somehow manage to prevent the purchasing?
If we decompose a filament into elementary space-time filaments, then to an entrance-point of an elementary filament through the lower boundary of the sichel, there corresponds an exit point of the same by the upper boundary, whereby for both, the product vdJ taken in the sense of (4) and (5), has got the same value. If we denote the velocity of the light relative to the tube by W, then this is given by the equation (A) or (B), according as the Galilei transformation or the Lorentz transformation corresponds to the facts.
If we deny the relation between the body of axiomatic Euclidean geometry and the practically-rigid body of reality, we readily arrive at the following view, which was entertained by that acute and profound thinker, H. Poincare: Euclidean geometry is distinguished above all other imaginable axiomatic geometries by its simplicity. If we deny the relation between the practically-rigid body and geometry, we shall indeed not easily free ourselves from the convention that Euclidean geometry is to be retained as the simplest. If we desire sincerely and passionately the safety, the welfare and tbe free development of tbe talents of all men, we sball not be in want of the means to approach such a state.
If we desire sincerely and passionately the safety, the welfare and the free development of the talents of all men, we shall not be in want of the means to approach such a state. If we desire to adhere to our "old-time" three-dimensional view of things, then we can characterise the development which is being undergone by the fundamental idea of the general theory of relativity as follows : The special theory of relativity has reference to Galileian domains, i.e. If we develop E in powers of q2, we obtain, E = m+ m q2 + 3mq4 +... (45) 2 8 The second term of this expansion corresponds to the kinetic energy of the material particle in classical mechanics.
If we develop the expression for the kinetic energy in the form of a series, we obtain When is small compared with unity, the third of these terms is always small in comparison with the second, which last is alone considered in classical mechanics. If we did not have to live among intolerant, narrow-minded, and violent people, I should be the first to throw over all nationalism in favour of universal humanity. If we dip one hand into the cold water and the other into the hot, we receive a message from the first that it is cold and from the second that it is hot. If we divide (p^, p^, P3, p^) by this magnitude, we obtain the four values (w^, co,, w,, w^^) = . If we do this we shall soon return to conditions that will allow us to rejoice in humanity.
If we drop these hypotheses, then the dilemma of Section 7 disappears, because the theorem of the addition of velocities derived in Section 6 becomes invalid. If we dt express this acceleration by partial differential coefficients, we obtain, after dividing by ?, ut? If we elevate the equivalence of all co-ordinate sys- tems for the formulation of natural laws into a prin- ciple, we arrive at the general theory of relativity, provided we stick to the law of the constant velocity of light or to the hypothesis of the objective signifi- cance of the Euclidean metric at least for infinitely small portions of four-dimensional space. If we finally limit ourselves to the consideration of the case when v is small compared to the velocity of liglit, it signifies that the components dx^ dx^ d,v.
If we follow the plot carefully, we arrive at the complete solution for ourselves just before the author's disclosure at the end of the book. If we for tbe moment disregard the additional cosmological term, the field equations take the form (1) where G denotes the contracted Riemann tensor of curvature, G the scalar of curvature formed by repeated contracting, and T the energy-tensor of " matter". If we form from the determinant scheme I a \ the minors of ^ and divide them by the determinat ^= | g j we get certain quantities g^^ = g^^ , which as we shall prove generates a eontravariant tensov- Accordino: to the well-known law of Determinants ' (16) ,^r^i' where o is 1, or 0, according asV= ^ or not.
If we form the approximation in question, all the components vanish with the one exception of T44 = p = T. On the Jea? If we form the determinant of the ? If we form the determinant of the quantities g '? If we form the vector difference of the vector (A ) at the point P2 and the vector obtained by parallel displacement from P1 to P2, we get a vector which may be regarded as the differential of the vector (A ) for the given displacement (dx?). If we had based our considerations on the Galileian transformation we should not have obtained a contraction of the rod as a consequence of its motion.
If we had reasoned on the basis of eguations (1) instead of (la), we should, on the contrary, have obt:tined the condition G = O, which would have to hold good everywhere for the g"' independently of the electric tield. If we had started from a Schwarzschild solution with negative rn, we should not have been able to make the solution regular by introducing a new variable u instead of r; that is to say, no "bridge" is possible that corresponds to a particle of negative mass. If we have these, we can ignore not only the architecture of the tower, but its very presence. If we have two noninteracting systems S1 and S2, we can write S1 = ?1(W1), S2 = ?2(W2). If we hold fast to the concept and practice of unlimited sovereignty of nations it only means that each country re?
If we however take that the curves along which we are differentiating are geodesies, we get from it by replacing 17^ according to (22) -[ dnV d'X ds ds Prom the interchan^eabilitv of the differentiation with regard to /x and v, and also according to (23_) and (21) we see that the bracket and V. l-i is sj'mmetrical with respect to ^ As we can draw a geodetic line in any direction from any point in the continuum, -^ is thus a four-vector, with an ds arbitrary ratio of components, so that it follows from the results of 7 that (25) A =_ 6'<A ft V is a co-viiriant tensor of the second rank. If we imagine an infinitely long tube, then the portions of waves, once started, will pursue their endless journey without interference.
If we imagine another c.s., another lift moving uniformly, relative to the one falling freely, then both these c.s. If we imagine constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface (similar to that above with the marble slab), we should find that different laws hold for these from those resulting on the basis of Euclidean plane geometry. If we imagine the electric charges to be invariably coupled to small rigid bodies (ions, electrons), these equations are the electromagnetic basis of the Lorentzian electrodynamics and optics of moving bodies. If we imagine these two masses as brought to rest-that is, if we take this energy of motion from them-then, considered together, they are essentially poorer in energy than was the originai atom.
If we increase the accuracy of the calculation, deviations from the theory of Newton make their appearance, practically all of which must nevertheless escape the test of observation owing to their smallness. If we increase the distance from the sphere twice or three times, then the density of the lines, in our space model, though not in the drawing, will be four or nine times less. If we interchange the words "mag- netic" and "electric", our sentence reads: "The change of a magnetic field is accompanied by an electric field." If we introduce Jand ?according to (30a) and (31), we obtain for the first component the expression ? If we introduce a new system of co-ordinates (?,?,?)
If we introduce into the latter a new Cartesian coordinate system (x'1, x'2, x'3) with the same origin, then x'1, x'2, x'3, are linear homogeneous functions of x1, x2, x3 which identically satisfy the equation x'12 + x'22 + x'32 = x12 + x22 + x32 The analogy with (12) is a complete one. If we introduce it in our expression, we get ds^ ^g^'^d^^ r/|^. If we introduce the cootravariant teosor AP .. = gf"T A in the la.st term, it assumes the form - AP ... If we introduce the ordinary time t, in place of the light-time l, then in (29) we must replace l by ct and v by v . If we limit ourselves to those transformations which have the determinant +13 (and only these arise from continuous variations of the systems of co-ordinates) then V is an invariant.
If we make no restrictive assumption as to the manner in which depends on the gl'" , g";, g: , q(rJ q,p)a, the energy-com? If we make such a transformation of a system of coordinates of the special theory of relativity, th'en the metric ds2 = dx 2 + dx22 + dxa2 -dxl goes over to a genera} (Riemannian ) metric of Bane ds2 = g dx dx (Summed over and v ) v " where the gv' symmetrical in and v, are certain functions of x1 a ax4 which descrfbe both the metric property, and the gravitational field in relation to the new system of coordinates.
If we make the necessary approximations, then all component vanish except ' T^^ = p = T. On the left-hand side of (^o) the second term is an infinitesimal of the second order, so that the first leads to the following terms in the approximation, which are rather interesting for us ; ^ f /^i^i , ^ r /xi^i , 6_ r /xvi _ 6_ r p^^'] ^y neglecting all differentiations with regard to time, this leads, when /x==v=4, to the expression ' 9'l4 12 3 158 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY The last of the equations (53) thus leads to (68) V'cj,,^Kp. If we make use of (oO) for non-magnetic bodies, and put accordingly H = B+, then in consequence of (C) in 8, (c-1) (E+)=:D^E-f ], i.e.
If we move the disc about, anywhere we like, on the surface of the globe, we do not come upon a limit or boundary anywhere on the journey. If we multiply (47b) by g";' , then because i) ga i)g: i;;:" i)X a a.nd, consequently, p.v i) (i)ff ) _ i) ( p.vi)ff ) gv ()x" i)g: -a i)x" g a i)g: we obtain the equation i) ( "'i)H ) i)X" gv i)g: or * .

If we multiply (6) by g^im and sum over the indices i and m, then we obtain after simple calculation: 2g^/xx (T + t) = 0 (9) where corresponding to (5) it is put for abbreviation: g^ t^ = t^_ = t (8b) Note, that it follows from the additional term, that in (9) the energy tensor of the gravitational field occurs besides that of matter in the same way, which is not the case in equations (21) l.c.. If we multiply (68) by ga and sum over the a, we obtain (69) (70) 2 ? If we multiply the skew-symmetrical tensor of rank 2 by the special skew-symmetrical tensor ? If we multiply this equation by u ? If we neglect the viscosity, the pressure, p, will be a scalar, and will depend only upon the density and the temperature of the fluid.
If we now again ascend one floor, to quantum physics, we shall have prob- ability waves in a six-dimensional continuum and not in a three-dimensional continuum as in the case of one particle. If we now fix, tliat for tv = y = z=^0, T= ^=:r;= ^=0, then the equations of transformation given in 3 (and 6) hold, and we have : y _/ With the aid of these equations, we can transform the above equations of motion from the system A- to the system K, and obtain : dt^ m ^3 ' di'' m ft \ c ) (A) d\ = 1 i(z+rM) m B \ c 7 dt^ m /5 32 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY Let US now consider, following the usual method of treatment, the longitudinal and transversal mass of a moving electron.
If we now form the reciprocal of this system of equations, firstly by solving the equations just obtained, and secondly by applying the equations to the inverse transformation (from k to K), which is characterized by the velocity ?v, it follows, when we consider that the two systems of equations thus obtained must be identical, that ? If we now imagine the length i cut off from the positive axes of these local systems, we get the orthogonal local n-leg. If we now introduce any four functions (./i i\ t'g t;'^) as co- ordinates, so that there is an unique correspondence between them, the equality of all the four co-ordinates in the new system will still be the expression of the space-time coincidence of two material points.
If we now introduce the method of writiuor with indices, we shall have (9) d{x,A-^:,)=:d,,^-> |^+ ^ d\ k o. If we now introduce, by any substitution, the space- time co-ordinates x^ ...-^'4, then in the new system g ^s are no longer constants, but functions of space and time. If we now modify this 1 given vector by writing . If we now refer such a domain to a reference-body K1 possessing any kind of motion, then relative to K1 there exists a gravitational field which is variable with respect to space and time.2) The character of this field will of course depend on the motion chosen for K1.
If we now think of a non- inertial system introduced by assum- ing that the new system is uniformly accelerated against the inertial sys- tem (in a three-dimensional descrip- tion) in one direction (conveniently defined) , then there exists with ref- erence to this system a static parallel gravitational field. If we now write a/HI t = lj in the place of I, then the differential expression dr"- = -(c?ic2 +%2 +(/2;2 +^^2)^ becomes symmetrical in (.- , 3/. If we ponder over the question as to how the universe, considered as a whole, is to be regarded, the first answer that suggests itself to us is surely this: As regards space (and time) the universe is infinite.
If we put aj/=:,c', x^' =y\ ,v^' = z\ x^=^it\ then immediately there occurs a homogeneous linear transfor- mation of (, y, z, t) to (r', y' y z y t') with essentially real co-efficients, whereby the aggregrate c^ ^2 _~2 _|_^2 transforms into ^'f ^ y' ^ z"^ -\- 1"^ , and to every such systetn of values , y, Zy t with a positive t, for which this aggregate >o, there always corresponds a positive t' ; This notation, which is due to Dr. C. E. Cullis of the Calcutta University, has been used throughout instead of Minkowski's notation, i SPACE-TIME VECTORS I^ this last is quite evident from the continuity of the aggregate x, y, z, t. The last vertical column of co-efficients has to fulfil, the condition 22) <^i 4^+^24^ +^34^ +'^4 4^ = 1.
If we put r A^ = A^ where k^ as well as A are vectors which can be arbi- trarily chosen, we obtain finally 1 ^=: ( V'-^g A^' ) . If we regard the whole universe as a closed system, we can proudly announce with the physicists of the nineteenth century that the energy of the uni- verse is invariant, that no part of it can ever be created or destroyed.

If we remember this and act accordingly, the problem of anti-Semitism, in so far as it is of a social nature, is solved for us.
If we repeat the experiment described under i , with only half a magnet suspended, the results are exactly the same as before ! If we replace x, y, z, , by x1, x2, x3, x4, we also obtaill the result that ds2 = dx12 + dx22 + dx32 + dx42. If we restrict ourselves to the case which almost exclusively offers itself to our experience, of v being small as compared with the velocity of light, this denotes that the components dx 1 dx 2 dx 3 ds' ds' ds are to be treated as small quantities, while dx4 / ds, to the second order of small quant1ties, is equa! If we ride in a train, we seem to move with incredible speed as long as we watch only nearby objects.
If we separate the motion of an oscillator electron into three components at angles to each other, we find for the average energy E of one of these linear components the expression E = (R/N) T, where R denotes the universal gas constant. If we set down this work as equal to the product Pv, where P is the pressure of light, we obtain P = 2 . If we set r' = - { ,v -r} (45) the equation of the motion of the point with respect to K1, becomes (46). If we set the disc rotating, a centrifugal force appears in the field. If we sit still and talk we are, from the physical point of view, creating sound waves, which spread from their resting source with the velocity of sound in air.
If we specialize the coordinate system in the ordinary way again, then we obtain instead of (2a) the equivalent equations: Rim = l im^l/xl + l i^l ml^ = (Tim 12 gim T) (6) g = 1 (3a) Like always we assume, that the divergence of the energy tensor of matter vanishes in the sense of the general differential calculus (Momentum-Energy theorem). If we state only what happens to the crowd of electrons when the experiment is repeated, not bothering about the behaviour of individual particles, the difference between the ringed and the striped pictures becomes comprehensible. If we stipulate that s2 = x?2 shall be equal to the square of the length in every system of co-ordinates, and if we always measure with the same unit scale, then ?
If we subject {x^, .c^, ,83, x^) and (2/1, y^, y^, yj simul- taneously to the Lorentz transformation (^21), the combina- tion (23) is changed to. If we substitute (2a) in this equation and compare with (1), we see that the xO?, must be linear functions of the x?. If we substitute in the right band side of the equation- ^ A' B*^ =^ A cr cr V V lU* PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY : fiemafka on the simplification of the mode of loriting the expressions. If we take a body R* which has got extension in space at time t^, then the region comprising all the space-time line passing through R* and ( shall be called a space-time filament. If we take our stand on the ground of classical mechanics, we can satisfy this requirement for our illustration in the following manner.
If we then dip both hands into the same warm water, we receive two con- tradictory messages, one from each hand. If we therefore put x' b x (3) or (3a) then the equivalence of equations (2) and (2a) is expressed in the form x'?2 =?x?2 ( independent of ? If we think of our invention as a model for a real magnet, we may say, assuming the existence of magnetic fluids, that a magnet is nothing but a magnet dipole y having at its ends two fluids of different kinds. If we think of the matter in arbitrary motion and neglect the pressures (particles of dust in vacuo, neglecting the size of the particles and the temperature), then the energy tensor will depend only upon the velocity components, u?
If we try to think of these lines of force as something material in the ordinary sense of the word, there is a temptation to ascribe the dynamic phenomena involved to their motion, each single line being followed out through time. If we use a strong source and succeed in making the hole small enough, a new and surprising phenomenon appears, something quite in- comprehensible from the point of view of the corpus- cular theory. If we use the co-ordinate system according to the above scheme, then- the total bending R of light-rays (reckoned positive when it is concave to the origin) is given as a sufficient approximation by oo S 1) >!
If we want to resist the powers which threaten to suppress intellectual and individuai freedom we must keep clearly before us what is at stake, and what we owe to that freedom which our ancestors have won for us after hard struggles. If we want to save the law of conservation of energy we must find where the transformations take place, and at what expense the heat is created. If we were to observe the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. If we wish to associate in some way a wave concept with a uniformly moving electron or electrons, our next question must be: what is the wave-length? If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, the values of its coordinates must be expressed as functions of time.
If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, we give the values of its co-ordinates as functions of the time. If we wish to interpret these lines of force to ourselves as something material in the ordinary sense, we are tempted to interpret the dynamic processes as motions of these lines of force, such that each separate line of force is tracked through the course of time. If we wish to know how many men and women over the age of twenty live in a city, we must get every citizen to fill up a form under the headings "male", "female " , and ' c age ' ' . If we would honor his memory worthily, we must get as clear a picture as we can of his problem and the stages of its solution.
If we younger people had known H. A. Lorentz only as a sublime mind, our admiration and respect far him would have been unique. If wo have an anatylical expression 6{x y^ r, t) so that B{xy y z ^) = is intersected by every space time line of the filament at one pointywhereby -(K)"-(f:)-(HiT)'>'if> then the tolality of the intersecting points will be called a cross section of the filament. If you always keep that in mind you will find a meaning in lif e and work and acquire the rigbt attitude toward other nations and ages. If you always keep that in mind you will find a meaning in life and work and acquire the right attitude towards other nations and ages.
If you bear this in mind, you will judge the attitude of the French, their refusal to disarm without security, less harshly than it is usually judged at present. If you get my message of greeting from all this distance, bethink you that ours is the first age in history to bring about friendly and understanding intercourse between people of different countries; in former times nations passed their lives in mutual ignorance, and in fact hated or feared one another. If you get my message of greeting from all this distance, re? If you have fallowed attentively my meditations up to this point, you will probably wonder about one thing. If you know, tell me quickly so that I may adopt your method with al! If you know, tell me quickly, so that I may adopt your method with all speed.
If you refuse to say anything, the man writes: "I ask ed one of N's supposedly best friends about him.

If, as was invariably the case, he had performed some dangerous operations in the morning, he would ring up on the telephone, immediately before we got into the boat, to enquire after the condition of the patients about whom he was worried; I could see how deeply concerned he was for the lives entrusted to his care. If, besides that, they use their intelligence from an individualist, i.e., a selfisb standpoint, building up their life on the illusion of a bappy unattached existence, things will be hardly better.
If, except for certain special cases, the iv function furnishes only statistical data conceming measurable magnitudes, the reason lies not only in the fact that the operation of measur-:? If, for example, the event consisted in the motion of material points, then, for this last case, nothing else are really observable except the encounters between tw^o or more of these material points. If, for example, the magnet moves and the conductor is at rest, then an electric field of certain energy-value is produced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, which excites a current in those parts of the field where a conductor exists.
If, for instance, I say, OThat train arrives here at 7 oclock, I mean something like this: The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events. If, for instance, a cloud is hovering over Times Square, then we can determine its position relative to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole perpendicularly on the Square, so that it reaches the cloud. If, for instance, a continuum of four dimensions be supposed available, we may represent it in the following way.
If, for instance, a magnet attracts a piece of iron, we cannot be content to regard this as meaning that the magnet acts directly on the iron through the intermediate empty space, but we are constrained to imagine N after the manner of Faraday N that the magnet always calls into being something physically real in the space around it, that something being what we call a "magnetic field." If, for instance, our embankment were the system K0 then our railway carriage would be a system K, relative to which less simple laws would hold than with respect to K0. If, further, D signifies the coefficient of diffusion of the suspended substance, and p the mass of a particle, as the result of diffusion there will pass across unit area in a unit of time, - D'M grams bX or 3 V 3X - D- particles.
If, further, the tensor APo- is symmetrical, this reduces to i 1- gP" AP" - "' - g"i)X . " If, further, we are going to do away completely with the vexing question as to the objective reason for the preference of certain systems of co-ordinates, then we must allow the use of arbitrarily moving systems of coordinates. If, further, we choose the xv so that they differ from zero only in the interior of a given domain, but in infinitesima.} If, further, we place two similar clocks (rotating with K'), one upon the periphery, and the other at the centre of the circle, then, judged from K, the clock on the periphery will go slower than the clock at the centre.
If, however, I notice the bluish something in neither case, and if I observe that the one continuously emits steam whilst the other does not, then I shall remain astonished and dissatisfied until I have discovered some circumstance to which I can attribute the different behaviour of the two pans. If, however, one introduces as unit of time instead of the second the time in which light travels 1 cm, c no longer occurs in the equations. If, however, one regard Euclidean geometry as the sci- ence of the possible mutual relations of practically rigid bodies in space, that is to say, treats it as a physical science, without abstracting from its original empirical content, the logical homogeneity of geometry and theoretical physics becomes complete.
If, however, the emission process has spatial symmetry, such as in the case of spherical waves, no recoil is produced at all. If, however, the source of light is a gas through which a current of electricity passes, the spectrum is of a different character. If, however, there exists one special c.s. If, however, there is some truth in the theory, its consequences must agree with observation. If, however, we QUANTA 309 try to begin from the classical description as proposed by the relativity theory, then our ascent to the quan- tum problem seems much more complicated. If, however, we replace the variable r by ?
If, in accordance with this, we insert x1 = x x2 = y x3 = z x4 = and similarly for the accented system K1, then the condition which is identically satisfied by the transformation can be expressed thus : x1'2 + x2'2 + x3'2 + x4'2 = x12 + x22 + x32 + x42 (12). If, in addition, Q tends to infinity with T, as will be assumed, the relation pnB% = pmBl (6) has to hold between the constants BTM and BTM. If, in order to prove this, we burden our selves with these various strenuous and dangerous occupations, we shall have gone far toward achieving the pacification of the world.
If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now supplement the propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two points on a practically rigid body always correspond to the same distance (line-interval), independently of any changes in position to which we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry then resolve themselves into propositions on the possible relative position of practically rigid bodies.1) Geometry which has been supplemented in this way is then to be treated as a branch of physics.
If, in view of the Disarmament Conference, we are not to restrict ourselves to the technical problems of organization involved but also to tackle the psychological question more directly from educational motives, we must try on international lines to invent some legal way by which the individual can refuse to serve in the army. If, instead of this, we had chosen another quantity, say B, having the eigenvalues b~, b2, b3, and eigen- functions v((x(), v2(x(), v3(x(), we should have obtained, instead of Eq. If, now, A and B are two points on a rigid body, we can construct the line joining them according to the rules of geometry ; then, starting from A, we can mark off the distance S time after time until we reach B.
If, now, the points of this space can be referred to coordinates x1, x2, x3, in such a way that the differences of the co-ordinates, x1, x2, x3, of the two ends of the interval furnish the same sum of squares, s2 = x12 + x22 + x32 (1) for every orientation of the interval, then the space of reference is called Euclidean, and the coordinates Cartesian.1 It is sufficient, indeed, to make this assumption in the limit for an infinitely small interval. If, on the other hand, he enters the room with a profound knowledge and a firm belief in the principles of physics, his explanation for the apparent breakdown of mechanics would be the assumption that the room rotates. If, then, a part of kinetic energy consists of field energy, might that not then be true of the whole of the kinetic energy.
If, then, experience is the alpha and the omega of all our knowledge of reality, what is the function of pure reason in science? If, then, it is true that this axiomatic basis of theo- retical physics cannot be extracted from experience but must be freely invented, can w'e ever hope to find the right way ? If, then, one must give up the attempt to give the coordinates an immediate metric meaning (differ- ences of coordinates = measurable lengths, viz., times), one will not be able to avoid treating as equivalent all coordinate systems, which can be created by the continuous transform- ations of the coordinates.
If, then, one tries to interpret the time of an event analogously, one needs a means for the measurement of the difference in time (in itself determined periodic process realized by a system of sufficiently small spa- tial extension) . If, then, the observer first measures the circumference of the disc with his measuring-rod and then the diameter of the disc, on dividing the one by the other, he will not obtain as quotient the familiar number ! If, then, we divide a beam of light into two parts, and send one-half swimming up the stream for a certain distance and then (by a mirror) back to the starting point, and send the other half an equal distance across stream and back, the across-stream beam should arrive back first. If, therefore, I bave a mass at a suffcient distance fro1>J.
If, therefore, velocity, change in velocity, and force are introduced for motion along a curved line, then they are automatically introduced for motion along a straight line. If, therefore, we have definitely assured knowledge, it must be grounded in reason itself. If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding lo this physical quantity.
If, without ma.king any change in the mean density, we imagine ma.tter to be non-uniformly distributed locally, tbere will be, over and above the rp w1th the constant value of equation (3), a.n additional cp, which in the neighbourhood of denser ma.sses will so much the more resemble the Newtonian field as ">..cp is sma.ller in comparison with 47r1ep. Ifwe keep in mind the distinction between the motion of the medium and the motion of the wave, we see that here they do not lie on the same line. Ignoring dispersion, = 1 - 1 / n2 This experiment demonstrated that matter does not completely carry along its ether but, in general, the ether is moving relative to matter. Ihave found t.!lat m both cases this is actually so. Iielativitf/ Theorem and 'Relativity'Principle.
Il we ask ourselves how the structure of society and the cultura!attitude of man should be changed in order to make human life as satisfying as possible, we should constantly be conscious of the fact that there are certain conditions which we are unable to modify. Ill By the world-postulate a similar treatment of the four determining quantities .r, ?/, 0, t, of a world-point is pos- sible. Ill ay be called a ^' Kay- figure " (Strahl-gebilde) of the space lime point B"^. Im- mediately a strange thing happens. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Imagine a bedbug completely flattened out, living on the surface of a globe. Imagine a better "timetable" giving the positions not for every second, but for, say, every hundredth or thousandth of a second.
Imagine a brightly shining lantern M somewhere in the plane of the orbit. Imagine a change in the second experiment. Imagine a circle drawn about the origin in the x'y' plane of K', and a diameter of this circle. Imagine a city inhabited by fiery-tempered, dishonest, and quarrelsome citizens. Imagine a co-ordinate system which is rotating uniformly with respect to an inertial system in the Newtonian man- ner. Imagine a flat-bottomed cup full of tea. Imagine a great lift at the top of a skyscraper much higher than any real one. Imagine a road perfectly smooth, and wheels with no friction at all. Imagine a serious scientist who believes that the law of inertia can be proved or disproved by actual experi- ments. Imagine a small charged sphere.
Imagine a speedometer attached to a stone, for example, so that its velocity vector may be drawn for any instant. Imagine a vector drawn at the point P2, using the local system of the X?, with the same co-ordinates (parallel vector through P2), then this parallel vector is uniquely determined by the vector at Pl and the displacement. Imagine a wheel rotating very quickly. Imagine an electron beam moving uniformly with a given velocity, or, to use the wave terminology, a homogeneous electronic wave, and assume that it falls on a very thin crystal, playing the part of a diffraction grating. Imagine for a moment that the field language is unknown and the results of this experiment have to be described, qualitatively and quantitatively, in the language of old mechanical concepts.
Imagine further that this sphere moves very fast in a circle at the centre of which is a magnetic needle. Imagine his feelings when the differ? Imagine that a light in the centre of the room is flashed on and off and, furthermore, that the walls of the room are transparent so that the observers, both inside and outside, can measure the velocity of the light. Imagine that at a given time, and at the point indicated by the dot, all these forces suddenly cease to act. Imagine that you wish to regard your room as your c.s. Imagine the following situation. Imagine the molecules of a gram of hydrogen so in- creased in size that they are visible through a microscope : say that the diameter becomes one five-thousandth of an inch, such as that of a Brownian particle.
Imagine the tower 256 feet high. Imagine two identical pieces of wood and suppose equal changes of temperature are induced by different methods; in one case by friction and in the other by contact with a radiator, for example. Imagine two mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surfaces face each other. Imagine two spherical conductors possessing equal charges, one positive and the other negative. Imagine, for the sake of sim- plicity, that some element emits only one line, that is, photons of a quite definite energy. Imagine, further, that we have given a large number of rigid rods, all equal to each other. Imagioe the following situation.
Immense progress was made in the theoretical penetration and understanding of whole groups of new phenomena; but the establishment of a unilived foundation for physics seemed remote indeed. Impressed forces are of different origins; as from percussion, from pressure, from centripetal force. In $=wF, we have a space time vector of the first kind with components <I>i=w,F2, +w3F23+w.,F2., I I * Vide note 15. In (a) the embankment, in (b) the carriage, serves as the body of reference in our statement of the motion taking place. In )901, Blondlot working with a stream of moving gas could not detect any such effect.
In 1895 H. A. Lorentzf published his theory of optical and electrical phenomena in moving bodies; this theory was based upon the atomistic conception (vorstellung) of electricity, and on account of its great success appears to have justified the bold hypotheses, by which it has been ushered into existence. In 1914, through the exertions of Prof. M. Planck of the Berlin University, he was appointed a paid member of the Koyal (now National) Prussian Academy of Sciences, on a salary of 18^000 marks per year. In 1915, Einstein made an excursion into Experimental Physics, and here also, in his characteristic way, he tackled one of the most fundamental concepts of Physics. In 1924 Einstein, to counteract the exploitation of his earlier d ecision by Ger?
In 1933, Einstein renounced his German citizenship and moved to the United States, a paper that earned him a Ph.D. from the where he lived until his death in 1955.

In Europe to the east of the Rhine free exercise of the intellect exists no longer, the population is terrorized by gangsters who have seized power, and youth is poisoned by systematic lies.

In Iess threatened parts it is nationalism and intoler- 44 IDEAS AND OPINIONS ance, as well as the oppression of the individuals by economie means, which threaten to choke these most precious tra? In Maxwell's equations, we realized a new pattern: structure laws connecting events here and now with events a little later in the immediate vicinity. In Maxwell's theory there are no material actors. In Maxwell's theory, if we know the field at one instant only, we can deduce from the equations of the theory how the whole field will change in space and time. In Minkowskis idiom this is expressed as follows:Not every extended conformation in the four-dimensional world can be regarded as composed of world-threads.
In Miphelson and Morley^s experiment, the distance travelled by the beam along OA (that is, in a direction parallel to the motion of the platform) is 2/^^, while the distance travelled by the beam along OB, perpendicular to the direction of motion of the platform, is ^lip. In Newton's theory reality was determined by a material point in space and time; in Maxwell's theory, by the field in space and time. In Newton's theory, on the contrary, only big steps connecting distant events are permissible. In Newton's time, and for more than a hundred years after, most physicists favoured the corpuscular theory. In Newtons equations of motion the concept of accelera- tion plays a fundamental part, which cannot be defined by the temporally variable intervals between points alone.
In Palestine it is not our aim to create another people of city dwellers leading the same life as in the European cities and possessing the European bourgeois standards and conceptions. In Part II we shall see in what way this result becomes modified in the general theory of relativity. In Plate III we give only one diffraction pattern obtained by one of the various methods. In Russia, they say, it is impossible to get a decent piece of bread.

In Section 6 we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities in one direction in the form which also results from the hypotheses of classical mechanics- This theorem can also be deduced readily horn the Galilei transformation (Section 11). In What Respects are the Foundations of Classical. In a certain sense, therefore, I hold it true that pure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamed. In a certainsense, therefore,I hold it to be true that pure thought is competentto comprehendthe real, as the ancientsdreamed. In a closed system, one isolated from external influences, the energy is conserved and thus behaves like a substance. In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality.
In a consistent theory of relativity there can be no inertia relativel y to" space," but only an inertia of masses relativel y to one another. In a continuum-theory atomic characteristics would be satisfactorily expressed by integral laws without localization of the formation entity which constitutes the atomic structure. In a generally relativistic theory we need n - 4 differential equations, in? In a given inertial system the coordinates meant the results of cer- tain measurements with rigid (sta- tionary) rods. In a good mystery story the most obvious clues often lead to the wrong suspects. In a healthy nation there is a kind of dynamic balance between the will of the people and the government, which prevents its degeneration into tyranny.
In a healthy society, every useful activity is compensated in a way to permit of a decent living.

In a man of my type the turning-point of the development lies in the fact that gradually the major interest dis- engages itself to a far-reaching degree from the momen- tary and the merely personal and turns towards the striving for a mental grasp of things. In a more formal sense also Newtons mechanics prepared the way for the field-theory.
In a particular department of theoretical physics the continuous field thus appeared side by side with the material point as the representa- tive of physical reality. In a sense they merely repre- sent unsatisfied desires of the scientific spirit in its struggle for a complete and unitary penetration of natural events by thought. In a similar manner we may indicate the distance (line-interval) between P and P1, as measured with a little rod, by means of the very small number ds. In a similar way, though not with the same precision, it is possible to calculate in advance the mode of operation of an electric motor, a trans?

In a space enclosed by completely reflecting walls, let there be a number of gas molecules and electrons which are free to move and which exert conservative forces on each other on close approach: i.e. In a stage when words intervene at all, they are, in my case, purely auditive, but they interfere only in a secondary stage, as already mentioned. In a systematic distribution of current (potential flow) all the vortex-filaments are concentrated at the walls. In a world govemment the ideological differences between the various component parts are of no grave consequence.

In a written document which I allowed the International League for combating Anti-Semitism to make use of for the purpose of enlisting support, and which was not intended for the Press at all, I also called upon all sensible people, who are still faithful to the ideals of a civilization in peril, to do their utmost to prevent this mass-psychosis, which is exhibiting itself in such terrible symptoms in Germany to-day, from spreading further.

In accordance with Euclidean geometry we can place them above, beside, and behind one another so as to fill a part of space of any dimensions; but this construction would never be finished; we could go on adding more and more cubes without ever finding that there was no more room. In accordance with Rieei and Levi-eivita, the contravariafits and co-variants are designated by the over and under indices. In accordance with definition the two clocks synchronize if . In accordance with experience we shall assume that the magnitude 2 AB 77 ~^ =zc, where c is a universal constant. In accordance with our criterion of reality, in the first case we must consider the quantity I' as being an element of reality, in the second case the quantity Q is an element of reality.
In accordance with the assumption to be considered here, the energy of a light ray spreading out from a point source is not continuously distributed over an increasing space but consists of a finite number of energy quanta which are localized at points in space, which move without dividing, and which can only be produced and absorbed as complete units. In accordance with the general theory of relativity space without an ether is inconc^t^ikp-PBTTh such a space there would not only be no propagation of light, but no possibility of the existence of scales and clocks, and therefore no spatio-temporal distances in the physical sense.
In accordance with the principle of relativity the length to be discovered by the operation (a)Nwe will call it Othe length of the rod in the moving systemON must be equal to the length l of the stationary rod. In accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly have to take for granted that the propagation of light always takes place with the same velocity w with respect to the liquid, whether the latter is in motion with reference to other bodies or not. In accordance with the special theory of relativity, certain co-ordinate systems are given preference for the description of the four-dimensional, space-time continuum.
In accordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a material point of mass m is no longer given by the well-known expression but by the expression This expression approaches infinity as the velocity v approaches the velocity of light c. The velocity must therefore always remain less than c, however great may be the energies used to produce the acceleration. In accordance with this notion, the establishment of a Jewish university in Jerusalem constitutes one of the most important aims of the Zionist organization. In addition Einstein introduced fundamentally new concepts of space and time, which served to destroy old fetishes and demanded a wholesale revision of scientific concepts and thus opened up new possibilities in the synthetic unification of natural processes.
In addition I may briefly remark that the following important law may easily be deduced from the developed equations: If an electrically charged body is in motion anywhere in space without altering its charge when regarded from a system of co-ordinates moving with the body, its charge also remainsNwhen regarded from the stationary system KNconstant.

In addition, the experience which has accumulated since the beginning of the so-called civilized period of human history hasNas is well knownNbeen largely influenced and limited by causes which are by no means exclusively economic in nature. In addition, the state considers it nec? In addition, the theory of Relativity accepted the results of Michelson and Morley's experiments as a definite principle, namely, the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, so that there was nothing left for explanation in the Michelson-Morle3^ experiment.
In addition, you try to prove that behind the idea of curtailing sovereignty the United States is hiding her intention of economie domination and exploitation of the rest of the world without going to war. In agreement with experience we further assume the quantity to be a universal constantNthe velocity of light in empty space. In agreement with experiment and with other theories, we obtain to a first approximation A P = 2 All problems in the optics of moving bodies can be solved by the method here employed. In all ages it has produced men who embodied the conscience of the Western world, defenders of human dignity and justice.
In all mechanical experiments, no matter of what type, we have to determine positions of material points at some definite time, just as in the above experiment with a falling body. In all motions of fluids (liquids or gases) where the effect of friction can be neglected, the following remarkable law holds good: If the fluid is moving at different velocities at different points in a uniform current, the pressure is less at those points where the velocity is greater, and vice versa. In all old expeiiments the velocity of light situated in free ether \Vas corn[)ared with the veloeitv of waves actually situated m a piece of moving matter and presumably carried away by it.
In all our arguments about the transition from classical physics to quantum physics we used the old pre-relativistic description in which space and time are treated differently. In all these cases some quantity of heat is created, a fact difficult to account for by the substance theory. In all these operations the operator lor plays the part of a space-time vector of the first kind. In an analogous manner we find, by considering rays moving along the two other axes, that when Thus substituting for x0 its value, we obtain ? In an analogous manner we obtain the length of co?
In an analogous manner, it is possible to demonstrate that the combined equations of gravitation and electricity ( with appropriate choice of the sign of the electrical member in the gravitational equations ) produce a singularity-free bridge? In an analogous way we shall introduce in the general theory of relativity arbitrary co-ordinates, x1, x2, x3, x4, which shall number uniquely the space-time points, so that neighbouring events are associated with neighbouring values of the coordinates; otherwise, the choice of co-ordinates is arbitrary. In an appendix, I have gone into discussion of the position of Classical Mechanics with respect to the Relativity Postulate.
In an attempt to save the fluid theory, we may assume that some con- stant force acts to regenerate the potential difference and cause a flow of electric fluid. In an early stage the words may correspond directly to im? In an early stage the words may correspond directly to impressions. In an inertial c.s., a moving body on which no forces are acting will move uniformly forever. In an interval of time r the x-Co-ordinates of the single particles will increase by d, where d has a different value (positive or negative) for each particle. In another war the bombs will be plentif ul and they will be comparatively cheap. In answering it we are on comparatively safe ground.
In anxious and uncertain times like ours, when it is difficult to find pleasure in humanity and the course of human affairs, it is particularly consoling to think of the serene greatness of a Kepler. In any case here is a possibility for a general relativistic theory of matter which is logically completely satisfying and which contains no new hypothetical elements. In any case it is a nationalism whose aim is not power but dignity and health. In any case it was absolutely necessary for Newton to perfect them, since they alone could provide him with the means of expressing his ideas. In any case it was quite sufficient for me if I could peg proofs upon propositions the validity of which did not seem to me to be dubious.
In any case one could believe it possible by and by to find a new and secure foundation for all of physics upon the path so successfully begun by Faraday and Maxwell. In any case, however great the space examined may be, we could not feel convinced that there were no more stars beyond that space. In any event, it is unthinkable to reject Planck's theory because it does not fit those fundamental principles. In any ontological question, the only possible procedure is to seek out these char- acteristics in the complex of sense experiences to which the concepts refer. In any space-time filament, let ns consider two cross- sections Q" and Q', which have only the points on the boundary common to each other ; let the space-time lines inside the filament have a larger value of t on Q' than on Q".

In attempting to judge the success of a physical theory, we may ask ourselves two ques- tions: (1) "Is the theory correct?" In attempting to trace the motion of every particle one would have to commence by finding the initial states, that is, the initial positions and velocities of all the particles. In axiomatic geometry the words "point," "straight line," etc., stand only for empty conceptual schemata. In axiomatic geometry the words point, straight line, etc., stand only for empty conceptual schemata. In botb cases we are dealing witb a collection of traditions and customs which do not form an organic whole. In both cases the asymmetry in relation to the fall in velocity in question is indirectly due to the oc- currence of a circular motion to which we will next direct our attention.
In both cases the force vectors lie on a line connecting the material points. In both theories, light is essentially an embodiment of the state of a hypothetical medium, the ether, which exists everywhere, even in the absence of light. In case of a Lorentz transformation A, since {^wK) (A -s) = /d; ,s, this expression is invariant.If 10 s =0, then w and 6' are perpendicular to each other. In case of a Lorentz-transformation A^ 10 is changed into u'' = 2uA, fmto/" = A~^ fA,therefore w' /' becomes =(wA A"^ /' A) = w/ A i.e. In classical mechanics it was tacitly assumed that a moving clock does not change its rhythm. In classical mechanics the resistance of a given body was something unchangeable, characterized by its mass alone.
In classical mechanics, and no less in the special theory of relativity, there is a.n inherent epistemologica.I defect which was, perhaps for the first time, clearly pointed out by Ernst Mach. In classical mechanics, inter- preted in terms of the field, the po- tential of gravitation appears as a scalar field (the simplest theoretical possibility of a field with a single component). In classical physics it was always assumed that clocks in motion and at rest have the same rhythm, that rods in motion and at rest have the same length. In classical physics, we had one clock, one time flow, for all observers in all c.s. In common parlance this may be described as pantheistic (Spinoza).
In con- trast to the former, it has room for the straight-line, that is to say a line all of whose elements are parallel to each other in pairs. In conclusion I wish to say that in working at the problem here dealt with I have had the loyal assistance of my friend and colleague M. Besso, and that I am indebted to him for several valuable suggestions. In connection with a specific illustration in Section 23, we found that the presence of a gravitational field invalidates the definition of the coordinates and the ifine, which led us to our objective in the special theory of relativity. In consequence of the arguments mentioned above, this expression for kinetic energy must also hold .for ponderable masses.
In consequence of this fact, it is no longer permissible to speak of the absolute simultaneity of two events. In consequence, we cm always write, instead of the vector 7i, the following set of four allied quantities 24 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY with the relation (27) o.i2+o)22+<0 32+a),2=:_ I From what has been said at the end of 4, it is clear that in the case of a Lorentz-transformation, this set behaves like a space -time vector of the 1st kind. In consideration of what has been shown hitherto, we obtain in place of (la) tP = - ": ..! In contrast to classical mechanics; the Lorentz transformation is the deciding factor in the transition from one such system to another.
In contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental importance for what follows. In contrast to ours, the universe of these beings is two-dimensional; but, like ours, it extends to infinity. In contrast to psy object "a real existence." In contrast to psychology, physics treats directly only of sense experiences and of the "under? In contrast to this we wish to understand by the "general principle of relativity" the following statement : All bodies of reference K, K1, etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena (formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their state of motion.
In corresponding manner, Schrodinger set himself the task of coordinating a partial differential equation for a scalar function 'l!J to the given energy function U ( qr, pr ) , where the qr and the time t are independent variables. In course of time their velocity will reach unheard-of values N provided that we are viewing all this from another reference-body which is not being pulled with a rope.
In course of time, the mathematical consequences will be gradually deduced, and enough suggestions will be forthcoming for the experimental verification oi' the postulate ; in this way even those, who find it uncongenial, or even painful to give up the old, time-honoured concepts^ will be reconciled to the new ideas of time and space, in the prospect that they will lead to pre-established harmony between pure mathematics and physics. In de Sitter's theory, the existence of vast quantities of world-matter is not required. In de- scribing the positions of objects and men in a city, the streets and avenues form the frame to which we refer. In describing them, we need not bother about air resistance or friction, for we may disregard their existence under our idealized conditions.
In doing so I had the good fortune of hitting upon books which were not too particular in their logical rigor, but which made up for this by permit- ting the main thoughts to stand out clearly and synoptically. In doing so, it is his intention to arrive at exact definitions for the signification of time- and space-data with reference to the circular disc K1, these definitions being based on his observations. In doing so, it remains at rest. In each branch of industry the number of working hours per week ought so to be reduced by law that unemployment is systematically abolished. In each glass two metal plates, one copper and the other zinc, are immersed in the solution. In each of these cases the result of the measurement is expressed by a number.
In every camp during the War this mass of voters betrayed their sacred trust. In every event in nature one form of energy is being converted into another, always at some well-defined rate of exchange. In every naturalist there must be a kind of religious feeling; for he cannot imagine that the connections into which he sees have been thought of by him for the first time. In every other point P' of space we so orient its local n-leg that its axes are parallel to the cor- responding axes at the point P. Given the above structure of space and free choice in the orientation of the n-leg at one point P, all n-legs are thereby com- pletely defined.
In every such framework we imagine three surfaces perpendicular to each other marked out, and designated as " co- ordinate planes " (" co-ordinate system "). In exactly the same way a theory which offers an explanation for the identity of gravitational and inertial mass is superior to one which interprets their identity as accidental, provided, of course, that the two theories are equally consistent with observed facts. In explaining optical and electrical phenomena Newton's mecbanics bas been far less successful than it had been in the fields cited above. In fact at that time it seemed that there was no problematical element in the concepts, Space and Time.
In fact the only objective assertion that can be made about the disc-shadows is just this, that they are related in exactly the same way as are the rigid discs on the spherical surface in the sense of Euclidean geometry. In fact thes j three axioms lead us from the previously mentioned fundamental equations for bodies at rest to the equations for moving bodies in an unambiguous way. In fact this was to be ex- pected on account of the principle of the inertia of energy. In fact, I would have been astonished had it turned out otherwise. In fact, Let us now on the olhei iiand take the ease of the tinit plane fj>^ normal to </> ; we can call this plane the 176 PlUxXCIPLE OF RELATIVITY Complement of </>. In fact, it follows from (50) that for q = 0, T44 = ?
In fact, it follows from the Lorentz transformation that a moving stick contracts in the direction of the motion and the contraction increases if the speed increases. In fact, it was this similarity which led W. Wien, some time ago, to an extension of the radiation formula in his important theoretical paper, in which he derived his displacement law Q = v*j{vlT). In fact, it will be shown when we consider Maxwell's equations that these may be looked upon as tensor equations, provided we regard the electromagnetic field as a skew-symmetrical tensor. In fact, our two-pillar structure could be reduced to only one, namely, to that based on Oersted's experi- ment. In fact, some one remarked jocularly that according to Planck, energy flies out of a radiator like a swarm of gnats.
In fact, the integra- tion of this equation over a three-dimensional volume V leads to the four equations (49a) d.v{ 1 ^ ^ dV ['^j( C - + f a, + / cr .^"'O 'IS (JENEE.VLISEID THEORY OE EEEATIVITY Ijl where a^, a^^ a.^ are the direetion-eosines of the inward- drawn normal to the sarface-elemeiit ^^S in the Euchdean Sense. In fact, the theory supplies us with a simple connection 1) between the space-expanse of the universe and the average density of matter in it. In fact, the unchangeable scale, rigidly con- nected with the earth, and a good clock are all we need, in principle, for the experiment. In fact, through this conception we arrive at the unity of the nature of inertia and gravitation.
In fact, we get from (48) by introducing the real components of the field intensity the following expressions well known from electrodynamics: ? In favor of the theory one can say that it ex- plains the atomistic character of matter as well as the circumstance that there exist no negative neutral masses, that it introduces no new vari- ables other than the gand y, and that in prin- ciple it can claim to be complete (or closed). In favor of this attempt one should also add that it is based on the simplest possible relativistic field equations known today. In front of a point source is placed a screen with a hole in it. In genera!, all special laws of formation of tensors are in? In genera!, only individuals of exceptional endowments, and exceptionally high-minded com?
In general entropy = k logW where k is a universal constant, and W is the probability of the state under consideration. In general people have contented themselves with reproducing and commenting on the official statements and orders of responsible members of the German Government, together with the programme for the annihilation of the German Jews by economic methods. In general the additional field-variables satisfy such differential equations that, in consequence of them, the divergence T,k. In general we can get all special laws of formation of tensors from (27) combined with tensor multiplication. In general, if a radiating body is placed before the prism, then the light it emits is split up into its components, revealing the spectrum characteristic of the emitting body.
In general, one obtains by division . In general, the operation of differentiation with ? In giving out SCIENCE AND RELIGION 47 punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be pass? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on Himself. In gravitational fields there are no such things as rigid bodies with Euclidean properties; thus the fictitious rigid body of reference is of no avail in the general theory of relativity. In guiding us in the creation of such an order of sense experiences, success alone is the deter mining factor. In his apparatus two weights caused a paddle wheel to turn while immersed in water. In his conversation with //, JV stated that a decision between the two theories was, in principle, experimentally possible.
In his introduction to his volume, An Inquiry Into M eaning and Truth, Russell has characterized this process in a marvelously concise fashion: We a1l start from "naive realism," i.e., the doctrine that things are what they seem. In his introduction to his volume,EAn Inquiry Into Meaning and Truth, Russell has characterized this process in a marvellously pregnant fashion: We all start from "naive realism," i.e., the doctrine that things are what they seem. In his language, the whole content of Euclidian geometry can axiomatically be founded upon the following statements: ( I ) Two specifed points of a rigid body determine a dis? In his remarks after the talk, Johannes Stark confirmed that a single X-ray had traveled as far as ten meters and ejected an equal energy electron from P2.
In his system everything is reduced to the following concepts: ( 1) Mass points with invariable mass; (2 ) action at a distance between any pair of mass points; ( 3) law of motion for the mass point. In his theory, Lorentz proceeds from certain equations, which must hold at every point of ^'Ather'^; then by forming the average values over *^^ Phy- sically infinitely small " regions, which how^ever contain large numbers of electrons, the equations for electro-mag- netic processes in moving bodies can be successfully built up.
In his treatise on light he wrote : If, in addition, light takes time for its passage which we are now going to examine it will follow that this move- ment, impressed on the intervening matter, is successive; and consequently it spreads, as sound does, by spherical surfaces and waves, for I call them waves from their resem- blance to those which are seen to be formed in water when a stone is thrown into it, and which present a successive spreading as circles, though these arise from another cause, and are only in a flat surface. In human freedom in the philosophical sense I am definitely a disbeliever. In it there are only one e!ectric and one magnetic fie!d vector. In its :6.rst stage of development, science does not contain anything else.
In its first stage which concepts belong to the primary of development, science does not con layer. In its initial stage the theory was yet quite unsatisfactory for the interior of matter, because there, two electric vectors had to be introduced, which were connected by relations ?ependnt on the nature of the medium, these relations being m.access1ble to any theoretical analysis. In its pure form, nowhere, not even in Judaism, where the pure doctrine is obscured by much worship of the letter. In its stationary aspect the elastic solid ether was the outcome of the search for a medium in which the light waves may "undulate." In its turn this magnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that the latter strives to move towards the magnet.
In justice I must add, moreover, that in Switzer- land we had to suffer far less under such coercion, which smothers every truly scientific impulse, than is the case in many another locality. In less exact terms we can express this by saying that by the "truth" of a geometrical proposition in this sense we understand its validity for a construction with rule and compasses. In less threatened parts it is nationalism and intoler? In like manner we imagine a system of v-curves drawn on the surface. In looking for a new foundation, be must try .to make clear in his own mind just how far the concepts wh1ch he uses are justified, and are necessities.
In looking for cept is not identical with the totality of a new foundation, he must try to make sense impressions referred to ; but it is a free creation of the human (or animal) clear in his own mind just how far the concepts which he uses are justified, and mind. In many cases a leader or ruler or a privileged class whose position rests on other factors combines priestly functions with its secular authority in arder to malte the latter more secure; or the political rulers and the priestly caste malte common cause in their own interests.
In many cases the leader or ruler whose position depends on other factors, or a privileged class, combines priestly functions with its secular authority in order to make the latter more secure; or the political rulers and the priestly caste make common cause in their own interests. In mathematical terms this means that physical (four-dimensional) space has a Rieman- nian metric. In mechanics we used only one clock. In mechanics, not one of the many c.s. In mechanics, we have seen: If the velocity of a material point is so and so, relative to one c.s., then it will be different in another c.s. In modern times this tradition has produced Spinoza and Karl Marx.
In most cases it is not pushfulness and lack of character that have made him what he is, but, as I have said, the suggestive power of an environment superior in numbers and influence. In most of the spectroscopic binary stars, ^^ are not only of the same order as T, but are mostly much larger. In my belief the name is justified; for the general laws on which the structure of theoretical physics is based claim to be valid for any natural phenomenon whatsoever. In my opinion the answer to this question is, briefly, this: As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.
In my opinion the answer to this question is, briefly, this:As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality. In my opinion the general theory of relativity can only solve this problem satisfactorily if it regards the world as spatially self-enclosed. In my opinion, accepting Planck's theory means denying the precepts of our radiation theory. In my opinion, deliverance can only come from the peoples themselves. In my opinion, nothing can be said a priori concerning the manner in which the concepts are to be formed and con lations between the "primary concepts," and in this way between sense experi ences.
In my opinion, the best method in this case is the violent one of conscientious objection, with the aid of organizations for giving moral and material support to the courageous conscientious objectors in each country. In my opinion, the fact that every bodily object situated in any arbitrary manner can be put into contact with the quasi rigid continuation of a predetermined and chosen body B0 (body of relation ), this fact is the empirica!basis of our conception of space. In my opinion, the partial world gov? In my opinion, the present manifestations of decadence are explained by the fact that economie and technologic develop?
In my opinion, the present symptoms of decadence are explained by the fact that the development of industry and machinery has made the struggle for existence very much more severe, greatly to the detriment of the free development of the individual. In my opinion, this concept of the interval, detached as it is from the selection of any special body to occupy it, is the starting point of the whole concept of space. In my teaching work I see with admiration that economic troubles have not yet succeeded in stifling the will and the enthusiasm for scientific research.
In my treatment of the planetary problem I chose these limiting conditions in tbe form of tbe following assumption : it is possible to select a system of reference so that at spatial infinity all the gravitational potentials g,,.v become constant. In my view the physical equivalence of C and C' with the assumption that the ether is at rest in respect to C but in motion with respect to C', though not abso- lutely wrong from a logical point of view, is never- theless unsatisfactory. In my view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are capable of it. In my view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it.
In nearly every detective novel since the admirable stories of Conan Doyle there comes a time when the investigator has collected all the facts he needs for at least some phase of his problem. In no way can such a beam of single colour be divided further. In one case the force acts in the direction of the motion, in the other case in the opposite direction. In one direction there is a constant gravitational force, in the other very many irregular blows from the molecules. In one essential this comparison must be regarded as highly superficial. In one of the most notable of these attempts Michelson devised a method which appears as though it must be decisive.
In one sense, the second theory is indeed a further generalisation of the restricted princijole, but the former does not really contain the latter as a special ease. In opposition to s ide, however, stand all the mechanical and electromagnetic-optical facts of our experience. In opposition to this, the concept of objective time, without which the formu? In optics we have to decide in favour of the wave theory against the corpuscular theory of light. In order not to allow any yawning gap to exist, we shall suppose that at every place and time, something perceptible exists. In order not to specify either matter or electricity, we shall simply style these as substances.
In order that equation (10a) may be a consequence of equation (10), we must have x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c2t'2 = _ (x2 + y2 + z2 - c2t2) (11). In order that the Rtk shall be defined and finite, it is not sufficient that there shall be, for the environment of every part of the continuum, a system of coordinates in which the g ,, and their first differential quotients are continuous and di:fferentiable, but it is also necessary that the determinant g shall nowhere vanish. In order that the first term on the right may also be a vector it is necessary for p?? In order that thinking might not degenerate into "metaphysics,'' or into empty talk, it is only necessary that enough propositions of the conceptual system be firmly enough connected.
In order that this acceleration may take place, a force has to act on the particle in a rightward direction. In order that this may be uniquely determined it is necessary to fix arbitrarily the length of a definite interval; for example, we can put it equal to 1 (unit of length). In order that you may appreciate this fully, suppose that a French citizen in a more or less analogous situation had got up a protest against the French Government's action in conjunction with prominent German statesmen. In order to account, also, for the equivalence of all mert1al systems with regard to all the phenomena of nature, i is necessary to postulate invariance of all sstems of phys1cal equations which express general laws, th regrd to e Lorentzian transformation.
In order to achieve the final aim-which is one world, and not two hostile worlds-such a partial world govemment must never act as an alliance against the rest of the world. In order to answer this question we must discuss some new experiments. In order to arrive at such forms, I sliall first of all ]mt the fundamental ecpiations in a typical form which brings out clearly their covarianee in case of a Lorentz-transformation. In order to arrive at this con? In order to attain the greatest possible clearness, let us return to our example of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling uniformly. In order to avoid speaking either of space or of vacuum, we may take this quantity as the ratio between the electro- static and eleetro-mas:netie units of electricity.
In order to be able to do this, we must first solve the following problem. In order to be able to look upon the rotation of the system, at least formally, as something real, Newton objectivises space. In order to be able to regard the rotation of a system at least formally as something real, Newton regarded space as objective. In order to be content men must also bave the possibility of developing their intellectual and artistic powers to whatever extent accord with their personal characteristics and abilities. In order to be more aware of this difficulty, let us interview the classical physicist and ask him some simple questions. In order to calculate it, we have to describe the radiation in a coordinate system K' which is at rest relative to the molecule in question.
In order to characterize a force it is not sufficient to state how hard we push the cart; we must also say in which direc- tion we push. In order to complete the definition of time we may employ the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light in a vacuum. In order to construct a theory, it is not enough to have a clear conception of the goal. In order to construct the ether as a jelly-like mechanical substance physicists had to make some highly artificial and unnatural assumptions. In order to create the right atmosphere, the most essential thing is personal co-operation between men of like mind. In order to decide this let us fix our attention upon a spe- cial Lorentz transformation re])resented by (10), (11), (1"^)?
In order to develop this idea within the limits of the modern theory of action through a medium, the properties of the spacetime continuum which determine inertia must be regarded as field properties of space, analogous to the electromagnetic field. In order to escape this dilemma, Seeliger suggested a modification of Newton's law, in which he assumes that for great distances the force of attraction between two masses diminishes more rapidly than would result from the inverse square law. In order to express in a real form, we write (74) S: Now X , = ^11 ^12 46 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY (75) Xy=m,M^+e,E,, Y, =m,M, +6'^E^ etc. In order to find out the general law-of-field of gravitation we still require to obtain a generalisation of the law as found above.
In order to free ourselves from this fatal error we shall speak only of "bodies of reference," or "space of reference." In order to get nearer to the behaviour of real matter we must add to the energy tensor a term which corresponds to the pressures. In order to give physical significance to the concept of time, processes of some kind are required which enable relations to be established between different places. In order to grasp its nature, one needs first of all to become acquainted with the principles on which it is based.
In order to have a better knowledge about the nature of the six- vector (which is the same thing as Minkowski's space-time vector of the 2n(l kind) let us take the special ease oP a piece of piano, having unit area (contents), and the form of a parallelogram, bounded by the four-veetors 21, V, passing through the origin. In order to have a complete description of the motion, we must specify how the body alters its position with time ; i.e. In order to illustrate my meaning, let me record here a personal experience. In order to justify this confidence, I am compelled to make use of a mathematical conception.
In order to learn this, we need only ask where the beginning of the rod and the end of the rod lie with respect to K at a particular time t of the system K. By means of the first equation of the Lorentz transformation the values of these two points at the time t = 0 can be shown to be the distance between the points being . In order to make the facts easily comprehensible, it ma}^ be more convenient to define a series of expressions, for the purpose of expressing the ideas in a concise form, while on the other hand I shall adhere to the practice of using complex magni- tudes, in order to render certain symmetries quite evident.
In order to measure time, we have supposed a clock, U, present somewhere, at rest relatively to K. But we cannot fix the time, by means of this clock, of an event whose distance from the clock is not negligible; for there are no "instantaneous signals" that we can use in order to compare the time of the event with that of the clock. In order to obtain Newton's theory as a first approxi- mation we had to calculate only g^^^ out of the 10 compo- nents (J of the gravitation-potential, for that is the only component which conies in the first approximate equations of motion of a material point in a gravitational field. In order to obtain the field caused by tlie electron at any world-point P^ let us construct the fore-cone belonging to Pj {vide fig.
In order to protect its citizens from attacks from without a modem state requires a formidable, expanding military establishment. In order to put his system into mathematical form at all, Newton had to devise the concept of differential quotients and propound the laws of motion in the form of total differential equations perhaps the greatest advance in thought that a single individual was ever privileged to make. In order to save itself from becoming hopelessly lost in this line of thought ( atomistic ), science proceeded :6.rst in the following manner. In order to see this we first remark that o^ .^ ^ co-variant four-vector when \p- and tjy are acalars.
In order to see this we suppose that two similarly made clocks are arranged one at the centre and one at the periphery of the circle, and considered from the stationary system K. According to the well-known results of the special relativity theory it follows (as viewed from K) that the clock placed at the periphery will go slower than the second one which is at rest. In order to see whether the derived relation yields an order of magnitude consistent with experience, we take P0 = 0, ? In order to show clearly what I mean by this question, I shall make use of a comparison.
In order to sliow that the field equations correspond to the laws of impulse and ener^ry, it is most convenient to write it in the following Hamiltonian form : f Hr/T= o (47a) ' ' VOL ^13 Here the variations vanish at the limits of the finite four-dimensional integration-space considered. In order to supplement this deficiency, one invents a system poorer in concepts and relations, a system retaining the primary concepts and relations of the "first layer" as logi?
In order to supply an explanation for this result, H. A. Lorentz formed a hypothesis which practically amounts to an invariance of optics for the group G,, According to Lorentz every substance shall suffer a contraction 1 \ V ^ r P^i length, in the direction of its motion T= "THE ''={'- 3- This hypothesis sounds rather }jhaotastical. In order to under- stand, however, what reasons and what difficulties force a change in important concepts, we must know not only the initial clues, but also the conclusions which can be drawn. In order to understand better the mechanism of the wave let us again consider an idealized experiment.
In order to understand his idea let us imagine that the velocity of light is not only finite, but also small, that the motion of light is slowed down, like that in a slow-motion film. In order to view this relation formally, let us consider the expression for the force acting upon unit volume of electricity, k = ?e+i x h (35) in which i is the vector velocity of electricity, with the velocity of light as the unit. In ordinary geometry distance between two points is one such magnitude ; so that hx'^ +^^^ H-5,e'^ is an invariant. In other words : Can we conceive of a relation between place and time of the individual events relative to both reference-bodies, such that every ray of light possesses the velocity of transmission c relative to the embankment and relative to the train ?
In other words the '' framework " itself is space and time. In other words, according to the accepted convention, all such vectors, as drawn below, may be regarded as equal; they lie along the same or parallel lines, are of equal length, and finally, have arrows pointing in the same direction. In other words, is the weight of a piece of metal the same whether neutral or charged? In other words, it is tradition - besides inherited aptitudes and qualities-which makes .us what we are. In other words, the elementary process of radiation seems to occur in such a way that it does not scatter the energy of the primary electron in a spherical wave propagating in every direction, as the oscillation theory demands.
In other words, the geometry of surfaces may be based upon this expression for ds2 exactly as plane geometry is based upon the corresponding expression. In other words, the hand exerts a force on the stone by means of the string. In other words, the laws according to which materia!bodies are arranged in space do not exactly agree with the laws of space prescribed by the Euclidian geometry of solids. In other words, the potential energy of 772 pounds elevated one foot above the ground is equivalent to the quantity of heat necessary to raise the temperature of one pound of water from 55 F. to 56 F. Later ex- perimenters were capable ofsomewhat greater accuracy, but the mechanical equivalent of heat is essentially what Joule found in his pioneer work.
In other words, there is interaction between ether and matter in optical pheno- mena, but none in mechanical phenomena ! In other words: However far we might travel through space, we should find everywhere an attenuated swarm of fixed stars of approrimately the same kind and density. In other words: is light propagated like sound? In other words: the plane is a two-dimensional continuum. In our analogy the probability wave corresponds to the deviation from the normal position in the acous- tical problem.
In our atime of high technical development, with a reasonably equitable division of labor and adeguate provisions for all, the individuai would have both time and strength to participate receptively and productively in the finest intellectual and artistic eff rts his abilities and inclinations allowed. In our attempts to understand the laws of nature we find, similarly, that the most obvious intuitive explanation is often the wrong one. In our case it is a simple matter to guess the right method of generaliza- tion. In our case the reader is also the investigator, seeking to explain, at least in part, the relation of events to their rich context.
In our case, we assumed the existence of a rigid bar and an ideal clock, without which it would be im- possible to check Galileo's law for falling bodies. In our case, we still find, for example, the concept of the electric charge in Maxwell's theory, though the charge is un- derstood only as a source of the electric field. In our day this barometer stands very low. In our endeavour to understand reality we are somewhat like a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch. In our first picture, the room moving with its light source carries the ether. In our great mystery story there are no problems wholly solved and settled for all time. In our idealized experiment the uniformity of the mo- tion was due to the absence of all external forces.
In our material world, nothing can be simpler than an electron, an elementary particle, on which no forces are acting, that is, an electron at rest or in uniform motion. In our mathematical treatment, such an encounter is expressed in the fact that the two lines which represent the motions of the points in question have a particular system of co-ordinate values, x1, x2, x3, x4, in common. In our next diagram only one line of force is drawn in order to clarify the procedure. In our own century a highly refined technique was devised for this purpose by Michelson. In our planetary system the earth and other planets move around the sun.
In our problem it corresponds to the ease when b}^ a suitable choice of the co-ordinate system, the special relativity theory holds throughout any finite region. In our problem this corresponds to the case in which," with a suitable choice of the system of reference, the special theory of relativity holds good for a finite region of the continuum. In our short review of the principal physical ideas we have met some unsolved problems, have come upon difficulties and obstacles which discouraged the attempts to formulate a uniform and consistent view of all the phenomena of the external world. In our times scientists and engineers carry particular moral responsibility, because the development of military means of mass destruction is within their sphere of activity.
In our world it happens that they are equal, but we can well imagine that this should not have been the case at all. In part the dangers were external: one might fall downstairs and break one's neck, lose one's liveli? In particular Niels Bohr was able largely to understand the structure of tbe atom, on the assumption that atoms can bave only discrete energy values, and that the discontinuous transi? In particular Ogases of equal probabilityO have frequently been hypothetically established when one theoretical models being utilized are definite enough to permit a deduction rather than a conjecture.
In particular it may remain an open question whether the theory of the electromagnetic feld in conjunction with that of the gravitational field furnishes a sufficient basis for the theory of matter or not. In particular we sha.11 make as few specializing a.ssumptions as possible, in marked contrast to Hilbert's treatment of tbe subject. In particular, Fizeau's experiments were explained, as well as the negative results of the above-mentioned attempts to detect the Earth's motion relative to the ether.
In particular, Lorentz's theory gives a good account of the non-existence of relative motion of the earth and the luminiferous " Ather ^' ; it shows that this fact is intimately connected with the covariance of the original equation, when certain simultaneous transformations of the space and time co-ordinates are effected; these transfoi;mations have therefore obtained from H. PoincareJ the name of Lorentz- transformations. In particular, it easily follows that by laying off n times the interval s upon a straight line, an interval of length n . In particular, it is completely incomprehensible why cathode rays produced photoelectrically or by X-rays acquire such a considerable velocity independent of the light's intensity.
In particular, it should be noted that the workers, through long and bitter politica!struggles, have succeeded in securing a somewhat improved form of the "free labor contract" for certain cate? In particular, it should be noted that the workers, through long and bitter political struggles, have succeeded in securing a somewhat improved form of the "free labor contract" for certain categories of workers. In particular, scientists arrived at a new law of motion for (rapidly moving) mass points, which was admirably confirmed in the case of electrically charged particles. In particular, the angular velocity of circulation, and therefore the centrifugal force, will be smaller near the bottom than higher up.
In particular, the constructions of plane Euclidean geometry can be carried out by means of the rods e.g. In particular, the derivatives of a scalar ?, are components of a co-variant vector, which, x? In particular, there will be no lower limit for the intensity of incident light necessary to excite the fluorescent effect. In particular, this interpretation brought it about that the electric and mag? In particular, we note, by (21), that a ray of light which referred to K has a velocity c, has a different velocity referred to K', depending upon its direction. In physics the bodies to which motions are spatially referred are termed systems of co-ordinates. In physics the body to which events are spatially re- ferred is called the co-ordinate system.
In piace of (18), we then have simply dT' = d-r, from which, in view of Jacobi's theorem, it fotlows that I i)X',, I = 1 i)X . In piace of Poisson's equation we write '\'P<P - \.<f> = 47r1Cp (2) where E. denotes a universal constant. In piace of field equation (13) we write G,... - )..,g,... = - K(T,... - g,...T) (13a). In place of (18) it fellows then simply that dr'^d from this it follows, remembering the law of Jacobi, (19) cr dx = 1 116 PIIINCIPLE of ilELATltlTY With this choice of co-ordinates, only substitutions with determinant 1, are allowable.
In place of (47), we get by working backwards the system /xv 2 -'ixv J V^g= l. It must be admitted, that this introduction of the energy-tensor of matter cannot be justified by means of the Relativity-Postulate alone ; for we have in the foregoing analvs's deduced it from the condition that the eners^v of the gravitalion-field should exert gravitating action in the same way as every other kind of (^nergy.
In place of the man walking inside the carriage, we introduce a point moving relatively to the co-ordinate system K1 in accordance with the equation x1 = wt1 By means of the first and fourth equations of the Galilei transformation we can express x1 and t1 in terms of x and t, and we then obtain x = (v + w)t This equation expresses nothing else than the law of motion of the point with reference to the system K (of the man with reference to the embankment). In place of the second term of this expression, we can, on account of the relations (50), put K i f 8 /^j, where t =: f \ fj, 2 /^ / 'i ii2 i'klNClPLE OF RLLAl'lViTY Tlierei'ore iii the ])]aee of the equations (47), we obtain (51) 6 a-' {'- a f3 a v/-r/=i.
In point of fact, if we substitute for x the value ct in the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation, we obtain: from which, by division, the expression x1 = ct1 immediately follows. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the gravitational field. In politics not only are leaders lacking, but the independence of spent and the sense of justice of the citizen have to a great extent declined. In politics not only are leaders lacking, but the independence of spirit and the sense of justice of the citizen have to a great extent declined. In practice such a step-by-step procedure would be extremely tedious as well as inaccurate.
In practice we can, of course, never completely free a body from all external influences. In practice, the question is tested in the following way. In practice, the rigid surfaces which constitute the system of co-ordinates are generally not available ; furthermore, the magnitudes of the co-ordinates are not actually determined by constructions with rigid rods, but by indirect means. In pre-quantum physics there was no doubt as to how this was to be understood. In pre-scientifc thinking, the solid earth's crust plays the role of B0 and its continuation. In preparation for such steps as these, youth must understand the importance of the problem.
In prescientific times it was not possible by means of thought alone to attain results that all mankind could have accepted as certain and necessary. In primitive peoples it is, first of all, fear that awakens religious ideas fear of hunger, of wild animals, of illness, and of death. In principle a field exists, ac- cording to him, only in empty space. In principle, it is possible to use the method applied for the motion of planets, but in prac- tice this is useless and must give way to the method of statistics.
In proportion as a theory becomes complex it loses in usefulnessa theory which is obliged to requisition a whole array of aibitrary assumptions in order to explain special facts is practically worse than useless, as it serves to disjoin, rather than to unite, the several groups of facts. In quantum me- chanics it is not so easily seen. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. In quantum mechanics it is usually assumed that the wave function does contain a complete description of the physical reality of the system in the state to which it corresponds.
In reality they limit the theoretical possibilities to such an extent, that no other theory than that of Maxwell and Lorentz has been able to hold its own when tested by experience. In reality we must make a subtle detour in order to be able to apply the postulate of general relativity exactly. In reality, behind these apparent causes there are indefinable factors of mass psychology about which we know little or nothing. In reality, however, it is a strong re? In recent years large and valuable stretches of Palestinian land have become the property of the Jewish people. In recent years, X-rays have been added to the domain of light, and in this direction also, Einstein's photo-electric formula has proved to be one of the most fruitful conceptions in Physics.
In refusing to outlaw the bomb while having the monopoly of it, this country suffers in another respect, in that it fails to retum publicly to the ethical standards of warfare farmally accepted previous to the last war. In regard to artistic matters, I have been genuinely impressed by the good taste displayed in the modem buildings and in arti? In regard to his subject matter, on the other hand, the physicist has to limit himself very severely: he must content himself with describing the most simple events which can be brought within the domain of our experience ; all events of a more complex order are beyond the power of the human intellect to reconstruct with the subtle accuracy and logical perfection which the theo- retical physicist demands. In relatively densely settled popula?
In relatively densely settled populations with the goods which are indispensable to their continued existence, an extreme division of labor and a highlycentralized productive apparatus are absolutely necessary. In remote and extremely complicated cases, involving the action of many bodies on each other, a mathematical descrip- tion is not so simple, but the fundamental principles are the same. In respect of the laws of disposition of the shadows L', the point S has no special privileges on the plane any more than on the spherical surface. In return, I expect the Academy to communicate this statement of mine to its members and also to the German public before which I have been slandered, especially as it has itself had a hand in slandering me before that public.
In school and at the university the young Jew is exposed to the influence of a society with a definite national tinge, which he respects and admires, from which he receives his mental sustenance, to which he feels himself to belong, while it, on the other hand, treats him, as one of an alien race, with a certain contempt and hostility. In seeking to answer them we have to abandon the description of atomic events as happenings in space and time, we have to retreat still further from the old mechanical view. In sending this greeting to you Japanese schoolchildren, I can lay claim to a special right to do so. In short, let us assume that the simple law of the constancy of the velocity of light c (in vacuum) is justifiably believed by the child at school.
In short, we can designate v as the relative velocity of the two systems. In simple cases the motion may be described and predicted by the aid of mathematics. In so far as geometry is conceived as the science of laws governing the mutual relations of practically rigid bodies in space, it is to be regarded as the oldest branch of physics. In so far as one can speak of the existence of rigid bodies in nature, Euclidian geometry is a physical science, the usef ul?

In speaking here concerning Ccomprehensibility," the ex? In special eases, where Q vanishes it follows from 81) that X,^=:Y,=Z,^ = T,^=:(Det^S)^ and if T^ and one of the three mag-nitudes X^^,, Yy. In spite of all the fruitfulness in particular, dogmatic rigidity prevailed in matters of principles: in the beginning (if there was such a thing) God created Newton's laws of motion together with the necessary masses and forces.
In spite of assiduous efforts, however, the theorists have not yet succeeded in replacing the principles of me- chanics by others which fit in with Plancks law of heat radiation or the quantum hypothesis. In spite of my honest attempts I find that language 0r at least my language-cannot do justice to tbe subject of this short piece of writing. In spite of the complete experimental confirmation of the theory as applied to diffraction, reflection, refraction, dispersion, etc., it is still conceivable that the theory of light which operates with continuous spatial functions may lead to contradictions with experience when it is applied to the phenomena of emission and transformation of light.
In spite of the fact ,that Newtons ambition to represent his system as necessarily conditioned by ex- perience and to introduce the smallest possible num- ber of concepts not directly referable to empirical objects is everywhere evident, he sets up the concept of absolute space and absolute time, for which he has often been criticized in recent years. In spite of the fact that, today, we know positively that classica!mechanics fails as a foundation dominating all physics, it still occupies the center of ali of our thinking in physics. In spite of the many experimental data and the many attempts to throw light on the nuclear problem, we are still in the dark about some of the most fundamental questions in this domain.
In spite of this, however, I believe that the theory is apt to beguile us into errar in our search for a uniform basis for physics, because, in my belief, it is an incomplete representation of real things, although it is the only one which can be bullt out of the fundamental concepts of farce and materia!points ( quantum corrections to classica! In spite of this, the investigator in another department of science would not need to envy the mathematician if the laws of mathematics referred to objects of our mere imagination, and not to objects of reality. In sucb a case the increase is too small to be measured directly; even with the most sensitive balance.
In such a ease, a spaoe-time line will be thouo^ht of as a principal line and by the term ' Proper-time ' of the filament will be understood the ^ Proper-time ' which is laid along this principal line ; under the term normal cross-section of the filament, we shall understand the cross-section upon the space which is normal to the principal line tbrousfh P. We shall now formulate the principle of conservation of mass. In such a system, the sun, or the common centre of gravity, lies in one of the foci of the orbital ellipse in such a manner that, in the course of a planet-year, the distance sun-planet grows from a minimum to a maximum, and then decreases again to a minimum. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion.
In such communities tradition and education have had a moderating influence and have brought about tolerable relations among the peoples living within those confines. In such fashion the principles of the conservation of me? In such periods discontent breeds hatred, and hatred leads to acts of violence and revolution, and often even to war. In such regions, therefore, the scalar of curvature is c9nstant, so that i>.. may be replaced by iG0 Thus we may write the earlier field equation (1) in the form (10). In talking about humana rights today, we are referring pri? In talking of it he often lamented the fact that this method of treatment was not endorsed by his colleagues. In tbe case of the specie.I theory of relativity the components dx 1 dx 2 dx 3 ds' ds' dS may take on any values.
In tbe following pages the reflexions will be given which, up to the present, I bave made on this fundamentally important question. In terms of Gaussian co-ordinates, every such statement is expressed by the agreement of their four co-ordinates x1, x2, x3, x4. In that case it may need many years of empirical research to ascertain whether the theoretical principles cor- respond with reality. In that case one could hope to deduce the concept of the mass-point together with the equations of the motion of the particles from the field equationsNthe disturbing dualism would have been removed. In that case, for each elementary emission process Zm->Zn a momentum of magnitude {emen)jc is transferred to the molecule.
In that case-and only after all e:fforts have been made in uhnost sincerity to obtain the cooperation of Russia and her allies-the other countries would have to proceed alone. In that section we concluded that the man in the carriage, who traverses the distance w per second relative to the carriage, traverses the same distance also with respect to the embankment in each second of time. In that sense one can say, according to Friedman, that the theory demands an expansion of space. In the :frst piace, the total feld appears in it to be composed of two logically unconnected parts, the gravitational and the electromagnetic.
In the Cartesian treat- ment on the other hand, all surfaces are, in principle, equally represented, without any arbitrary preference for linear figures in the construction of geometry. In the Euclidean geometry s2 is necessarily positive; it vanishes only when the two points concerned come together. In the General Theory of Relativity, this fundamental distinction is done away with. In the General Theory, physical laws are made independent of "absolute" motion of any kind. In the Lorentz transformation it changes and somehow behaves like the coordinate in the old transformation. In the Michelson-Morley experiment the arrangement is quite different. In the Middle Ages their performer would probably have been condemned; to us they seem both dull and illogical.
In the Restricted Theory, all '^unaccelerated" axes of reference were recognised as equally valid, so that physical laws were made independent of uniform absolute velocity. In the Schrodinger equation, absolute time, and also the potential energy, play a decisive role, while these two concepts bave been a recognized by the theory of relativity as inadmissible in principle. In the United States everyone feels assured of his worth as an individual. In the above-mentioned paper (Annalen der I'hysik, p. 649, Bd. In the absence of a gravitational field, that is in any unaecelerated system, the velocity of light will always remain constant.
In the adjoining figure let K be the spherical surface, touched at S by a plane, E, which, for facility of presentation, is shown in the drawing as a bounded surface. In the article on Electron-theory (Ency, Math., Wiss., Bd. In the attempt to understand the pheno- mena of nature from the mechanical point of view, throughout the whole development of science up to the twentieth century, it was necessary to introduce artificial substances like electric and magnetic fluids, light corpuscles, or ether. In the authorised translation this was supplemented with "Tranfalgar Square, London". In the awakening and strengthening of tbese psycbological forces in the young man, I see the most important task given by the scbool.
In the awakening and strengthening of these psychological farces in the young man, I see the most important task given by the school. In the beginning, the field concept was no more than a means of facilitating the understanding of phenomena from the mechanical point of view. In the breathing spell thus provided we would have to prepare more thorogh meases. In the calculation we have employed the second of Maxwell's systems of equations ntp.v + cfiv p + cfip. In the case above, the state of the resonator system is defined by its total energy, so the question to be answered reads: how many ways can a given total energy be distributed among N resonators? In the case of Newton's experiment the prism separates them in space. In the case of a rainbow, drops of water play the role of the prism.
In the case of blackbody radiation, ? In the case of blackbody radiation, therefore, ?/? In the case of longitudinal waves the particles of the ether would move along the axis, as the beam does. In the case of lying this might perhaps be done in some way such as this: Lying destroys confidence in the statements of other people. In the case of one individual electron, the experimental result was incomprehensible. In the case of our two conductors, the electricity thus flows from positive to negative. In the case of our waves set up by a pulsating sphere the wave-length is the distance, at some definite time, between two neighbouring spherical shells showing maxima or minima of density.
In the case of political, and even of religious, leaders it is often very doubtful whether they have done more good or harm. In the case of political, and even of religious, leaders, it is often very doubtful whether they have done more good or harm. In the case of rectilinear motion our concepts of velocity, change of velocity, and force proved most useful. In the case of rectilinear motion, the distance, and therefore the force as well, is invariant. In the case of skew-symmetry the components with two equal indices vanish, and the components with unequal indices are equal and opposite in pairs. In the case of symmetry in question, (41) may therefore be replaced by the two forms .jA,,.
In the case of the cord, we ask about the deviation of an arbitrary point from its normal position at an arbitrary moment. In the case of the planets moving around the sun it is found that the system of mechanics works splendidly. In the case of the sound wave in the room moving uniformly, relative to the outside observer, the follow- ing intermediate steps are very essential for our con- clusion : The moving room carries the air in which the sound wave is propagated. In the case of the special relativity theory, the components <^.<;^ dx^ dx^ ds ds ds 156 PIUKCIPLE OF llELATlVitY can take any values ; This signifies that any velocity can appear which is less than the velocity of light in vacuum (i^ <1).
In the case of the switchback we made a guess that some of the mechanical energy was converted into heat. In the case of the theory of surfaces, Gauss's argument is as follows. In the case of two solenoids, we should have to investigate the forces with which two currents act upon each other. In the case of waves on a sea or river it is the distance from the trough of one wave to that of the next, or from the crest of one wave to that of the next. In the case where the forces are conservative we can easily recognize the vector character of (X?) In the case, of the substances investigated by Herr Lenard, PE 8is always significantly greater than R? In the centre the non-diffracted ray is visible.
In the classical mechanics as well as in the special relativity theory", the co-ordinates of time and space have an immediate ph3^sical significance ; when we say that any arbitrary point has .>\ as its X^ co-ordinate, it signifies that the projection of the point-event on the X^-axis acertained by means of a solid rod according to the rules of Euclidean Geometry is reached when a definite measur- ing rod, the unit rod, can be carried ,e^ times from the origin of co-ordinates along the X^ axis. In the classical transformation it is always the same time in all c.s.
In the conductor, however, we find an electromotive force, to which in itself there is no corresponding energy, but which gives riseNassuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussedNto electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case. In the connection of the foundation with all the single parts lies its great significance, but likewise its greatest danger in face of any new factor. In the corpuscular theory the velocity of light has a very definite meaning. In the course of my long lif e I have received from my fellow-men far more recognition than I deserve, and I confess that my sense of shame has always out?
In the course of this, however, one had to introduce the hypothesis, that the scalar of the energy tensor of matter vanishes. In the discussion of Section 6 we have to do with places and times relative both to the train and to the embankment. In the early nineteenth century, scientists wanted to reduce all physics to simple forces acting on material particles that have definite positions and velocities at any instant. In the end the choice will be made according to which kind of descrip? In the environment of an electrically charged body there is a magnetic feld which furnishes an ( apparent ) contribution to its inertia. In the equation x1 = wt1 B) we must then express x1and t1 in terms of x and t, making use of the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation.
In the equations of an electro-magnetic field, apart from the density of the electrical charge nothing appears except the strength of the field. In the equations of the electromagnetic field there occur, in addition to the densities of the electric charge, only the intensities of the field. In the essay excerpted here, and first pub lished in 1936, Einstein demonstrates his sub Germany in 1879 and educated in physics and stantial interest in philosophy as well as sci mathematics at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic ence. In the evolution of philosophic thought throngh the centuries the fallowing question has played a major role: what knowl?
In the ex- ample of a photon or an electron and two pinholes we have seen that we cannot describe the possible motion of elementary particles in space and time as we did in classical physics. In the example of the transmission of light just dealt with, we have seen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive theoretically the influence of a gravitational field on the course of natural processes, the Iaws of which are already known when a gravitational field is absent. In the field language this sentence reads: the field of the electric charge changes with time. In the fiojure drawn, this cross-section has been intentionally drawn with a different breadth. In the first case the cart is accelerated by the push, in the second case decelerated, or slowed down.
In the first drawing the positions of the hands of the upper and lower clocks are, by convention, the same because we arranged them so. In the first instance it must be guaranteed by Iaw. In the first pages of our book we compared the role of an investigator to that of a detective who, after gathering the requisite facts, finds the right solution by pure thinking. In the first part of this book we were able to make use of space-time co-ordinates which allowed of a simple and direct physical interpretation, and which, according to Section 26, can be regarded as four-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. In the first piace we set ds = - 'Yikdx,d xk + dx (i, k = 1, 2, 3) (11). In the first place it introduces a new hypothetical substance, and we already have too many substances in physics.
In the first place it is clear that the equations must be linear on account of the properties of homogeneity which we attribute to space and time. In the first place we entirely shun the vague word "space," of which, we must honestly acknowledge, we cannot form the slightest conception, and we replace it by "motion relative to a practically rigid body of reference." In the first place we require to determine the points A and B of the embankment which are just being passed by the two points A1 and B1 at a particular time t N judged from the embankment. In the first place, it can be compared with the reality. In the first place, it is assumed that one can move an ideal rigid body in an arbitrary manner.
In the first place, it is contrary to the mode of thinking in science to conceive of a thing (the space-time continuum) which acts itself, but which cannot be acted upon. In the first place, we imagine an existence in two dimensional space. In the first place, we started out from the assumption that there exists a reference-body K, whose condition of motion is such that the Galileian law holds with respect to it : A particle left to itself and sufficiently far removed from all other particles moves uniformly in a straight line. In the first two years of the atomic era another phe? In the first volume of Chwolson's excellent physics textbook, he states in the introduction to ether, "The hypothesis of this one agent's existence is extraordinarily close to certainty."
In the first, we have the magnetic field of a current flowing through a solenoid; in the second, the field of a bar magnet. In the following I wish to present the line of thought and the facts which have led me to this point of view, hoping that this approach may be useful to some investigators in their research. In the following linesIshall try to describe briefly how the matter stands. In the following pages we shall present the fundamental ideas of the special theory of relativity. In the following section we shall show to what extent this is actually the case, and how this question is connected with the general postulate of relativity.
In the following we make these assumptions (w^hich we shall subsequently call the Principle of Relativity) and introduce the further assumption,an assumption which is at the first sight quite irreconcilable with the former onethat light is propagated in vacant space, with a velocity c which is independent of the nature of motion of the emitting bod}'. In the following we shall consider the experimental facts concerning blackbody radiation without invoking a model for the emission and propagation of the radiation itself. In the following we shall show that it is possible to do this in a natural way, that the question we are raising can be answered in the afhrmative.
In the following, this equation will be interpreted in accordance with the principle introduced into physics by Herr Boltzmann, namely that the entropy of a system is a function of the probability its state. In the following, this gap shall be closed on the basis of a new point of view introduced by Mr D Bose, which enabled this author to establish a most remarkable derivation of Plancks radiation formula . In the following, we differentiate gravitation-field from matter in. In the foregoing it has been assumed that the energy of at least some of the quanta of the incident light is delivered completely to individual electrons. In the frst instance it must be guaranteed by law. In the further development of science both of these concepts are extended and gener- alized.
In the general case, the product will be the geometric sum of two parallelopipeds, but it can always be represented by a four-vector of the 1st type. In the general ease, we can not by any suitable choice of axes, make special rela^^ivity theory valid throughout any finite region. In the general laws of nature which have been formulated with reference to K, the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the carriage would necessarily play a part. In the general theory of relativity the doctrine of space and time, or kinematics, no longer figures as a fundamental independent of the rest of physics. In the generalized theory of relativity, the doctrine of space and time, kinematics is no longer one of the absolute founda?
In the generally recognised kinematics, we silently assume that the lengths defined by these two operations are equal, or in other words, that at an epoch of time t, a moving rigid body is geometrically replaceable by the same body, which can replace it in the condition of rest. In the geometry of the Greeks, space plays only a qualita? In the gravitational case there is only attraction, but electric forces may either attract or repel. In the hyper- surfaces of contact of the two sheets the deter- minant of the gvanishes. In the immediate neighbourhood of an observer, falling freely in a gravitational field, there exists no gravitational field.
In the interest of clearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should repeat myself frequently, without paying the slightest attention to the elegance of the presentation. In the introduction of the concept of fluids we see the influence of those mechanical ideas which attempt to explain everything by substances and simple forces acting between them. In the kinetic theory of matter and in all its impor- tant achievements we see the realization of the general philosophical programme: to reduce the explanation of all phenomena to the interaction between particles of matter. In the kinetic theory of matter we see how this view, arising from mechanical problems, embraces the phenomena of heat and how it leads to a successful picture of the structure of matter.
In the kinetic theory of molecules, for every process in which only a few elementary particles participate (e.g., molecular collisions), the inverse process also exists. In the language of Minkowski this is expressed as follows: Not every extended entity in the four-dimensional world can be regarded as composed of world-lines. In the latter case, a third body can be inserted between them without altering them in any way, in the former not. In the light of knowledge attained, the happy achievement seems almost a matter of course, and any intelligent student can grasp it without too much trouble. In the light of this simple theory all the facts men- tioned here seem comprehensible.
In the limited nature, of the mathematically existent simple fields and the simple equations pos- sible between them, lies the theorists hope of grasp- ing the real in all its depth. In the limitting case =1, /x=l, cr=:0, the vector N=0, S=pa), a)K=0, and we obtain the ordinary equations in the theory of electrons. In the manner indicated in Section 2 we can imagine this reference-body supplemented laterally and in a vertical direction by means of a framework of rods, so that an event which takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this framework. In the material presented here we have no basis for deciding between these two alternatives.
In the meantime Einstein has announced his withdrawal from the Academy, giving as his reason that he cannot continue to serve the Prussian State under its present Government. In the meantime more exact reflection shows that this denial of the existence of the ether is not de- manded by the restricted principle of relativity. In the meantime the intellectual worker, due to his lack of organization, is less well protected against arbitrariness and exploitation than a member of any other calling. In the meantime there still remains outstanding an important problem of the same kind, which has often been proposed but has^ so far found no satisfactory solution ^namely the e^irplanation of atomic structure in tenfis ot*r<^^d theory.
In the mechanics reformed according to the world- postulate, the disharmonies which have disturbed the relations between Newtonian mechanics, and modern electrodynamics automatically disappear. In the middle of the circuit was a magnetic needle. In the midst of this I discovered that, according to atomistic theory, there would have to be a movement of suspended microscopic particles open to observation, without knowing that observations concerning the Brownian motion were already long familiar. In the new field language it is the description of the field between the two charges, and not the charges themselves, which is essential for an understanding of their action. In the next drawing we see a wave which presents a comparatively wide front as it marches along.
In the next drawing, the velocity vectors for three different positions of a particle moving along a curve are shown. In the oreneral relativity theory time and space magnitudes cannot be so defined that the difference in spatial co-ordinates can be immediately measured by the unit-measuring rod, and time- like co-ordinate difference with the aid of a normal clock. In the paucity of the mathematically existent simple field-types and of the relations between them, lies the justification for the theorist's hope that he may comprehend reality in its depths. In the philosophical sense there is, in my opinion, no specifically Jewish outlook. In the physics of measurement this is attained by the application of the Cartesian system of co-ordinates.
In the possibility of such a representation lie the sole value and justification of the whole system, and especially of the concepts and fundamental prin- ciples which underlie it. In the pre-relativity physics space and time were separate entities. In the pre-relativity physics this problem was solved by making unconsciously two hypotheses: 1) Time is absolute; the time of an event, t', relatively to K' is the same as the time relatively to K. If instantaneous signals could be sent to a distance, and if one knew that the state of motion of a clock had no influence on its rate, then this assumption would be physically validated.
In the presence of matter it shares in the motions of the latter and has a velocity every- where in empty space; the etheric velocity nowhere changes discontinuously. In the present case we can divide the problem into parts by considering first only events which are localised on the x-axis. In the present case we have to ask ourselves how we can represent that relation of solid bodies with respect to their reciprocal disposition (contact) which corresponds to the theory of a finite universe. In the present stage of technical development, only a supranational organization, equipped with a sufficiently strong executive power, can protect us.
In the present state of theory it looks as if the electro- magnetic field, as compared with the gravitational field, were based on a completely new formal motive ; as if nature, instead of endowing the gravitational ether with fields of the electro-magnetic type, might equally well have endowed it with fields of a quite different type, for example, fields with a scalar po- tential. In the present treatment, geometry is related to actual things (rigid bodies), and its theorems are statements concerning the behaviour of these things, which may prove to be true or false. In the real switchback, where friction prevents the car from again reaching as high a point as that from which it started, there is still a continuous change be- tween kinetic and potential energy.
In the relativity theory it depends on both rest mass and velocity. In the restricted theory of light, the principle of constancy of light velocity demands that 8ir2 +8^^ -|.8^2 __^2g^,2 should remain constant. In the retrospect tb1s result does not appea.r astonishing. In the same category, moreover, we :flnd the fundamental hypotheses of the theory of relativity, which theory has led to an unexpected expansion and broadening (if the unit of time is chosen in such a manner that the speed of light e = 1). In the same way I believe that the United Nations should have the atomic bomb when it is supplied with its own armed forces and weapons. In the same way it follows from (8) and (9) that the contravariant four-vector may be taken in this sense as a. contravariant tensor of the first rank.
In the same way, any such lines in our continuum correspond to many points in motion. In the scale used, one inch stands for 40 m.p.h. In the schools, history should be used as a means of interpreting progress in civilization, and not far inculcating ideals of imperialistic power and military success. In the second drawing, we see the relative positions of the two c.s. In the second place, a protest against injustice and violence is incomparably more valuable if it comes entirely from people who have been prompted to it purely by sentiments of humanity and a love of Pew This cannot be said of a man like me, a few who regards other Jews as his brothers.
In the second place, classical mechanics exhibits a deficiency which directly calls for an extension of the principle of relativity to spaces of reference which are not in uniform motion relatively to each other. In the second place, it is assumed that the behaviour of ideal rigid bodies towards orientation is independent of the material of the bodies and their changes of position, in the sense that if two intervals can once be brought into coincidence, they can always and everywhere be brought into coincidence. In the second, the room moving with its light source does not carry the ether. In the service of life sacrifice becomes grace. In the simplest case, these two felds were connected by the dielectric constant, but in principle they were considered and treated as independent entities.
In the sj^stem K, at a great distance from the origin of co-ordinates, let there be a source of electrodynamic waves, which is represented with sufficient approximation in a part of space not containing the origin, by the equations : X=Xo sin ^ "] L=Lo sin <l> ^ Y=Yo sin $ y M=MoSin$ ^ ^=o>(^-^!!!:2^!!! In the smaller entities of community life, man has made some progress toward breaking down anti-social sovereign? In the space P let us now imagine any Gaussian system of co-ordinates and that in every point the axes of the n-leg there are projected on to it. In the space- time region considered there is a gravitation-fiekl which generates the accelerated motion relative to K'.
In the special theory of relativity, as Minkowski had shown, this metric was a quasi-Euclidean one, i.e., the square of the length ds of the linear element was a definite quadratic function of the differentials of the co- ordinates. In the state of knowledge then existing his attempt was bound to fail. In the system K, very far from the origin of co-ordinates, let there be a source of electrodynamic waves, which in a part of space containing the origin of co-ordinates may be represented to a sufficient degree of approximation by the equations X = X0 sin?, L = L0 sin?, Y = Y0 sin?, M = M0 sin?, Z = Z0 sin?, N = N0 sin?, where .
In the temperature graphs the one-dimensional temperature continuum is combined with the one-dimensional time continuum into the two-dimensional temperature-time continuum. In the temple of Science are many mansions, and various indeed are they that dwell therein and the motives that have led them thither. In the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are faced with the difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an account of their nature. In the theor}^ for bodies at rest, the combinations (X^, X^, X., Y,, 1^, Y., Z^, Z,, Z,) are known as '^Maxwell's Stresses/' T T,, T, are known as the Poynting's Vector, T/ as the electro- magnetic energ^^-density, and L as the Langrangian function.

In the totalitarian states it is the rulers themselves who strive actually to destroy that spirit of humanity. In the train, the trunks fall off the luggage racks; on the ship, tables and chairs are thrown about and the passengers become seasick. In the transformations we have go; an undetermined function <^ (? In the two drawings the dotted vectors show the direction of the force as truly as they indicate the change in velocity.
In the vectorial way of writing, we have I I curl m - = Ci, II J div ex=p III \ curl E + ^97 = IvVliv M=o The velocity of matter occurs only in the auxilliary equations which characterise the influence of matter on the basis of their characteristic constants e, /^, a. In the whole history of science from Greek philo- sophy to modern physics there have been constant attempts to reduce the apparent complexity of natural phenomena to some simple fundamental ideas and re- lations.
In the wonderful two months which I have been privileged to spend in your midst in this fortunate land, I have had many opportunities of observing what a high value men of action and of practical life attach to the efforts of science; a good few of them have placed a considerable proportion of their fortunes and their energies at the service of scientific enterprises and thereby contributed to the prosperity and prestige of this country. In the work of Young and Fresnel this result was experimentally realized and theoretical conclusions were drawn.
In the year 1900, Prof. Planck of the Berlin University worked out a formula which was based on the bold assumption that energy was emitted and absorbed by the molecules in multiples of the quantity hv^ where // is a constant (which is universal like the constant of gravitation), and v is the frequency of the light. In the year nineteen hundred, in the course of a purely theoretic investigation, Max Planck made a very remarkable discovery: the law of radiation of bodies as a function of temperature could not be derived solely from the laws of Maxwellian electrodynamics. In their childhood individuals connected by the same language grasp these rules and relations mainly by intuition.
In their labors they will bave to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in human? In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautif ul in humanity itself. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a persona! In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In their universe there is room for an infinite number of identical squares made up of rods, i.e.
In thermodynamic equilibrium S is a maximum, where, apart from (3), the constraints that the total number n of atoms and their total energy E be constant have to be satisfied.

In these days of democratic government the fate of the nations hangs on themselves; each individual must always bear that in mind. In these days of mud-slinging, some of it vile, some of it ridiculous, a good word for the German people from you in particular might have produced a great effect, especially abroad. In these fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory, but it has considerably simplified the theoretical structure, i.e.
In these great matters success is not a matter of cleverness, still less of cunning, but of honesty and confidence. In these investigations, the expressions which are obtained by the multiplication of two alternating matrices /- THE PRODUCT OF THE FIELD-VECTORS /f 4t5 are of much importance. In these pages we have often seen how ideas created and developed in one branch of science were afterwards successfully applied to another. In these ten years confidence in the stability, yes, even the very basis for existence, of human society has largely vanished. In these times of economie depression and politi? In these two bodies, we have now images of twD Lorentz-electrons, one of which is at rest and the other moves uniformly.
In this " closed up " system, light rays will come to a focus after travelling round the universe and we should see an ''anti-sun'"' (corresponding to the back surface of the sun) at a point in the sk}^ opposite to the real sun. In this ( b) is nothing more than an important special case of ( e). In this 9 66 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY equation, we obtain the energy-law for the motion of the material point and the expression m e-')"-('j-=+i^**) may be called the kinetic energy of the material point. In this Formula ' a ' signifies the semi-major axis, r, the velocity of light, measured in the usual way, e, the eccentricity, T, the time of revolution in seconds. In this analogy an understanding not only of the similarities but also of the differences is most important.
In this attempt I cannot lay any claim to being an authority, especially as intelligent and well-meaning men of ali times have dealt with educational problems and bave certainly repeatedly expressed their views clearly about these matters. In this attempt I cannot lay any claim to being an authority, especially as intelligent and well-meaning men of all times have .dealt with educational problems and have certainly re? In this case also the function f must satisfy, in its changes, the equation (I). In this case it is not the demand that is lacking but the consumers' purchasing-power. In this case it is not the demand that is!acking but the consumers' purcbasing-power.
In this case it is well possible that such an individual in retrospect sees a uniformly syste- matic development, whereas the actual experience takes place in kaleidoscopic particular situations. In this case it will not be possible to describe the whole field by means of a single coordinate system without introducing singularities. In this case not only the direction but the magnitude of the velocity, as indicated by the length of the vector, varies during the motion. In this case relations hold in the four-dimensional continuum which are analogous to those holding in our three-dimensional measurements. In this case the Universe must necessarily form a closed space of finite size, this size being determined by the value of the mean density of matter.
In this case the magnet and not the current is the " source" of the field. In this case the metal, the human body, and the earth form one vast conductor, with the electric fluid so diluted that practically nothing remains on the electroscope. In this case the two fluids cannot mix, so that the gold leaves retain an excess of one electric fluid and remain apart. In this case the universe must of necessity be spatially unbounded and of finite magnitude, its magnitude being determined by the value of that mean density. In this case the whole motion would be muddled and it would be impossible to confirm, in the case of distant double stars, the validity of the same gravitational law which rules over our planetary system.
In this case we should be constrained to believe that natural laws are capable of being formulated in a particularly simple manner, and of course only on condition that, from amongst all possible Galileian co-ordinate systems, we should have chosen one (K0) of a particular state of motion as our body of reference. In this case, as in many mental disorders, the cure lies in a clear knowledge of one's condition and its causes. In this case, because of the absence of singularities, the field equations determine both the field and the motion of the particles. In this case, each molecule species has its own OcellsO. In this complex of feelings, constructive and destructive farces lie close!y to? In this complex of feelings, constructive and destructive forces lie closely to?
In this connection I should like to give expression to an idea which has occurred to me recently. In this connection a Galileian reference-body serves as body of reference, i.e. In this connection it devolves upon the University to create something unique in order to serve the specific needs of the forms of life developed by our people in Palestine. In this connection the individual rods always represent the same distance, independently of their position. In this connection the relation between the ordinary and the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei transformation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the Lorentz transformation.
In this connection we have not taken account of the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the velocity of propagation of light. In this connection we proceed in principle according to the method which has already been explained for measuring-rods, clocks and freely moving material points. In this diagram a body of finite extent is represented, at a definite time l, by the interval AB; the whole space-time existence of the body is represented by a strip whose boundary is everywhere inclined less than 45 to the l-axis. In this ease, we have to remember that the energy-tensor of matter is exclusively defined in a narrow sense by the density p of matter, i.e., by the second member on the right-hand side of 58 .
In this equation, c is the speed of light in vacuo, x, y, z, t are the space-time coordinates in K, and x', y', z', t' are those in K'. In this example, as we as in the Schwarzschild case, a solution free singularities at all finite points is made possible by the intmduction of the modified gravitational Eqs (3R). In this experiment the magnetic lines of force coil themselves around the current. In this exposition the use of mathe- matical symbols cannot be avoided. In this expression a represents the major semi-axis of the ellipse, e its eccentricity, c the velocity of light, and T the period of revolution of the planet.
In this field, however, I soon learned to scent out that which was able to lead to fundamentals and to turn aside from everything else, *from the multitude of things which clutter up the mind and divert it from the es- sential. In this formal respect Newtons con- ception of the differential law constitutes the first de- cisive step in the development which followed. In this formula a denotes the major semi? In this formula, k=RjN is the well-known Boltzmann constant, and pn is a number, independent of T and characteristic for the molecule and its nth quantum state, which can be called the statistical 'weight' of this state. In this general (and intentionally somewhat vaguely stated) form this sentence is probably today commonly accepted.
In this he succeeded (for a complex function 'l!J ) in such a manner that the theoretical values of the energy Ha , as required by the statistica!theory, actually resulted in a satisfactory man? In this ideal limitting case =1, fji=l, o-=:o, E will be equal to e, and M to m. At every space time point {j-, y^ z, t) we shall have the equations* (i) Curl m = pu (ii) div e= p (iii) Curl^ +.||' = (iv) div m = (? In this latter statement absolutum means not only "physically real," but also "independent in its physical properties, having a physical effect, but not itself influenced by physical conditions."
In this limiting process where the closed curve shrinks to a point, size and shape automatically vanish from our considerations and we obtain laws connecting changes of magnetic and electric field at an arbitrary point in space at an arbitrary instant. In this manner a time-value is associated with every event which is essentially capable of observation. In this manner pbysics ( at least part of it ), originally more pbenomenologically con? In this mechanics of Newton, and in contrast to the above conceptions of space derived from rigid bodies, the space Bo enters in a form which contains a new idea; it is not for every B0 that validity is required (for a given law of force) by ( b) and ( e) , but only for a B0 in the appropriate condition of motion ( inertial system ).
In this methodological uncertainty, one might suppose that there were any number of pos- sible systems of theoretical physics all with an equal amount to be said for them; and this opinion is no doubt correct, theoretically. In this paper Einstein uses L to denote energy; the italicised sentence in the conclusion may be written as the equation Om =L/c2O which, using the more modern E instead of L to denote energy, may be trivially rewritten as OE=mc2O. In this post, he has only to do and guide research work. In this process the original concepts are often modified so as to advance the under- standing both of those phenomena from which they sprang and of those to which they are newly applied.
In this respect Fresnelian ether cannot be said to behave in any respectable physical fashion, and this led Stokes, in 1845-46, to construct a more material type of medium. In this respect he is even further removed from the Russian and the Asiatic than the European is. In this respect, it is important to realize that the means of production-:-that is to say, the entire productive capacity that is needed for producing consumer goods as weII as additional capita} goods - may legaIIy be, and for the most part are, the private prop?
In this respect, it is important to realize that the means of productionNthat is to say, the entire productive capacity that is needed for producing consumer goods as well as additional capital goodsNmay legally be, and for the most part are, the private property of individuals.For the sake of simplicity, in the discussion that follows I shall call "workers" all those who do not share in the ownership of the means of productionNalthough this does not quite correspond to the customary use of the term. In this respect, the problem of the theory of invariants may be so formulated: according to what laws may new tensors be formed from given tensors? In this respect, the working classes in this country have only begun their development.
In this respect, therefore, the purely metrical (Riemannian) space is less rich in structure than the Euclidean. In this sense I am speal<ing of a religion of fear. In this sense I believe that the priest must become a teacher if he wishes to do justice to his lof ty educational m.ission. In this sense I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves such an ethical basis I call more proper for a herd of swine. In this sense R" is to be regarded as the cross-section normal to the t axis of the filament at the point t=t' y and the volume of the body R" is to be resrarded as the contents of the cross- section. In this sense it is a further extension of Newtonian Relativity. In this sense one could say that the constant c is only an apparently uni- versal constant.
In this sense one speaks of ''physical reality." In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of man? In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these valnes and goals and constantly to strengthen and extend their effect. In this sense the example represents a gravitational 6CM, independent of x~ and x~, which ends in a plane covered with mass and forming a boundary of the space. In this sense there exists an analogy between the theory of relativity and thermodynamics. In this sense thinking and language are linked together. In this sense we can imagine a spherical space. In this sense we cannot speak of space in the abstract, but only of the "space belonging to a body A."
In this sense we speak of the special principle of relativity, or special theory of relativity. In this sense, religion forms an important part of education, where it receives far too little consideration, and that little not sufficiently systematic. In this sense, therefore, the universe according to Newton is finite, although it may possess an infinitely great tota! In this sense, we shall now introduce the following supposition; that for an infinitely small four-dimensional region, the relativity theory is valid in the special sense when the axes are suitably chosen. In this situation, both the gas and the radiation will affect the plate. In this state of aff airs it was necessary to think of materiai particles as mass points subject to Newton's laws of motion.
In this state of affairs, and since Gc is mathematically more in- telligible than G oo, a mathematician may, by a free play of imagination, hit upon the thought that natural pheno- mena possess an invariance not onl}^ for the group G^, but in fact also for a group G^, where c is finite, but yet 10 74 PRINCIPLE OF KELATIVITY exceedingly large compared to the usual measuring units. In this system single experiences must be corre? In this the physical assumption is essential that the relative lengths of two measuring rods and the relative rates of two clocks are independent, in principle, of their previous history. In this way any velocity may be denoted by a vector, and conversely, if the scale is known, one may ascertain the velocity from such a vector diagram.
In this way creatures which cannot leave the spherical surface, and cannot even peep out from the spherical surface into three- dimensional space, might discover, merely by experimenting with discs, that their two-dimensional "space" is not Euclidean, but spherical space. In this way creatures which cannot leave the spherical surface, and cannot even peep out from the spherical surface into three-dimensional space, might discover, merely by experimenting with discs, that their twodimensional space is not Euclidean, but spherical space. In this way he succeeded in explaining hitherto inexplicable cases of wounds ailing to heal, and in bringing about a cure.
In this way it is possible for the mean density of matter to be constant everywhere, even to infinity, without infinitely large gravitational fields being produced. In this way it might perhaps be possible to establish a proper balance between production and consumption without too great a limitation of free enterprise, and at the same time to stop the intolerable tyranny of the owners of the means of production (land, machinery) over the wage-earners, in the widest sense of the term. In this way it was possible to discover that these sun- earth directions all lay in a plane stationary with reference to the fixed stars, at least according to the accuracy of observation achieved in those days, when there were no telescopes.
In this way one succeeds in avoiding singularities of that special kind which is characterized by the vanishing of g. The solution (1) naturally has no deeper physical significance insofar as it extends into spatial infinity. In this way perhaps a greater number of creative individuals could be given an opportunity for mental development than is possible at present. In this way the community may regain its health, and we will hope that future historians will explain the morbid symptoms of present-day society as the childhood ailments of an aspiring humanity, due entirely to the excessive speed at which civilization was advancing. In this way the community may regain its health, and we will hope that future historians will explain the morbid symptoms of present?
In this way we determine its length. In this way we may succeed in making the problem of pacificism an acute one, a real struggle which attracts forceful natures. In this way we shall be able to avoid getting ourselves quite so often into the position, disagreeable for Jews and Arabs alike, of having to call in the mandatory Power as arbitrator. In this way, a shift of the interference pattern was produced, from which Fizeau could derive the influence of the object's velocity on the absolute velocity. In this way, by using as stepping-stones the practice in thinking and visualisation which Euclidean geometry gives us, we have acquired a mental picture of spherical geometry.
In this way, every problem of the optics of moving bodies would be reduced to a series of problems of the optics of stationary bodies. In this way, he found his radiation formula, which agrees with all of our experience hitherto = 8h (/c)3 (1 / (eh/kT - 1)) It might seem that, in accordance with this derivation, Planck's radiation formula follows from the present electromagnetic theory. In this way, the lines of force, or in other words, the field, enable us to determine the forces acting on a magnetic pole at any point in space. In this, I believe, our oscillation theory does not hit the mark. In those days men strove for a larger political unity, which at that time was called Germany. In three dimensions, the plane can be represented by the vector ])er})endicu1ar to itself.
In ths sense I have never looked upon ease and happi? In times of crisis people are generally blind to everything outside their immediate necessities. In tlns way it seems possible to get for matter and its interactions a pure field theory free of additional hypotheses, one moreover whose test by submission to facts of experience does not result in difficulties other than purely mathematical ones, which difficulties, however, are very serious. In treating mechanical problems, we are therefore obliged to make use of an inexact description of matter, which corresponds to that of classical mechanics. In trying to understand this expression, one notices at once that it is the sum of two terms. In two respects this result is of great importance.
In two weeks the sheep-like masses can be worked up by the newspapers into such a state of excited fury that the men are prepared to put on uniform and kill and be billed, for the sake of the worthless aims of a few interested parties. In two weeks the sheeplike masses of any country can INTERVIEWERS 15 be worked up by the newspapers into such a state of excited fury that men are prepared to put on uniforms and kill and be killed, for the sake of the sordid ends of a few interested parties. In view of the existing conditions and in view of the generai characteristics of human beings, this, I frankly admit, repre?
In view of the fact that the periodic terms in (31) are very small, it is not possible to decide out of astronomical observations between sueh a law (with the modified mechanics proposed above) and the Newtonian law of attraction with Newtonian mechanics. In view of the present situation of world Jewry, it is now more then ever necessary to preserve the Jewish community in a vital form. In view of the resuIts of these considerations we are led to the conviction that, according to the general principle of relativity, the space-time continuum cannot be regarded as a Euclidean one, but that here we have the general case, corresponding to the marble slab with local variations of temperature, and with which we made acquaintance as an example of a two-dimensional continuum.
In view of the small time-differences following from the theory, very ingenious experimental arrangements have to be thought out. In view of these endeavors I am particularly pleased to note that, in the last chapter of the book, it finally turns out that one can, after all, not get along without "metaphysics.'' In view of these endeavours I am particularly pleased to note that, in the last chapter of the book, it finally crops out that one can, after all, not get along without "metaphysics." In view of these evident facts there is, in my opinion, only one way out. In view of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it than to abandon either the principle of relativity or the simple law of the propagation of light in vacuo.
In view of this situation, you may think it desirable to have some Permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. In virtue of the latter property we speak of a " continuum," and owing to the fact that there are three coordinates we speak of it as being " three-dimensional." In what follows we deduce some properties of this tensor which, it is true, apply to any tensor of the second rank. In what follows, we shall again consider these important deductions, and we shall also discuss the empirical evidence appertaining to them which has hitherto been obtained. Ina dices occurring twice in e. term are e.lways to be taken e.s summed.
Inaddition to the most elementary precepts directly motivated by the preservation of life and the sparing of unnecessary suffering, there are others to which, altl10ugh they are apparently not quite commensura? Incidentally I am only coming to Princeton to do research, not to teach. Incidentally I am only coming to Princeton to research, not to teach. Increase in the unprod uctive burden of armaments. Increase in the unproductive burden ofarmaments. Indeed according to the theory of Ritz, the velocity should become c + n, when the source or light moves towards the observer with the velocity n. Prof, de Sitter has ojiven an astronomical arsjument for decidinoj between these two diverejent views.
Indeed it was this analysis which led Newton and Leibnitz to the discovery of differential calculus. Indeed there is no doubt that to this process-which one may describe as a spiritualizing of the emotions and of thought-that to it man owes the most subtle and refined pleasures of which he is capable: the pleasure in the beauty of artistic creation and of logica! Indeed this country has conducted its Russian policy as though it were convinced that fear is the greatest of all diplomatic instruments. Indeed, according to the opinion of many positivists the com- pletest possible accomplishment of this task is the only end of science. Indeed, even the divinization of humanity, as an abstract totality, would not be in the spirit of that ideai.
Indeed, it is not difficult to formulate such a theory in which, as in Newton's theory, the gravitational fields can be reduced to a scalar which is the solution of a partial differential equation. Indeed, it is not very difficult to guess how to describe in quantum physics a system composed of two interacting particles. Indeed, it is quite enough to know the results obtained by an observer in one c.s. Indeed, it looks as if our disasters had actually quickened the devotion to non-material goods. Indeed, not two, but four, numbers must be used to describe events in nature. Indeed, one would not arrive at our conclusion if one insisted that two or more physical quantities can be regarded as simul- taneous elements of reality only +hen they can be simultaneously measured or predi cted.
Indeed, quanti- tative methods of reasoning enable us to deduce the velocity of light in a refractive medium if we know how the beam refracts when passing into it. Indeed, the essential step was just the reduction of electromagnetism to Maxwell's equations in empty space or-as it was expressed at that time-in ether. Indeed, the experiment produces what is undoubtedly one of the great achievements of the theory: the phenomenon of diffraction for electronic waves. Indeed, we find in nature projectiles with such velocities. Indeed, we have repulsion of two positive charges and attraction of two masses. Indeed, we shall soon find that the new concepts intro- duced here are interwoven with those already familiar, and with those we shall still meet.
Indeed, we shall soon witness the rise of another theory, based on entirely different concepts, yet explaining the same domain of optical phenomena. Indications of this cosmic religious sense can be found even on earlier levels of development for example, in the Psalms of David and in the Prophets. Individual Jews no doubt produced great work, but it seemed as if the Jewish people as a whole had not the strength left for great collective achievements. Industrial installations, however complex, can be duplicated; inventive ingenuity and economic resources can be exploited under other systems of government.
Inertia, gravitation, and the metrical behavior of bodies and clocks were reduced to a single field quality; this field itself was again placed in de- pendence on bodies (generalization of Newtons law of gravity or the field law corresponding to it, as formulated by Poisson). Inertial systems are in rectilinear and uniform motion with respect to each other. Inevery camp during the War this group of voters betrayed their sacred trust. Inguiding us in the creation of such an order of sense experiences, success in the result is alone the determining factor. Inmy opinion, it is not reasonable even to talk of "our way of!ife" or tbat of tbe Russians.
Inmy opinion, nothing can be said concerning the manner in which the cdncepts are to be made and connected, and how we are to coordinate them to the experiences. Inner Pressure Gravitational Force Suppose the piston were pushed down so as to com- press the gas to a fraction of its former volume, say one-half, its temperature being kept unchanged. Inner and Mixed Multiplication of Tensors.-Tbese consist in a combination of outer multiplication with contraction. Inner and mixed muUiplicatiori of Tensors. Innumerable voices have been asserting for some time now that human society is passing through a crisis, that its stability has been gravely shattered. Inorder further to approach this goal, we must make up our mind to accept the fact that the logica!
Inpaying homage to this man, the American National Acad? Inserting the results of this paragraph into (5), one obtains for the equilibrium entropy the expression . Inserting the right-hand side of (58b) in (57a), we obtain the Euleri'tn hydrodynamical equations of the general theory of relativity. Inserting the value of y , we obtain in the first piace l2cp dx,,, dxv lcp d2x,,, X = l x,,,lxv ds ds + l x,,, ds2 The existence of a tensor cannot be deduced from this iorth? Inside material bodies no less than in empty space the ether alone, not atomically conceived mat- ter, was the seat of electro-magnetic fields. Insof ar as the labor contract is "free," what the worker receives is deter?
Insofar as the labor contract is "free," what the worker receives is determined not by the real value of the goods he produces, but by his minimum needs and by the capitalists' requirements for labor power in relation to the number of workers competing for jobs. Inspired no doubt by the uniformity of planetary motions, Newton conceived the idea that the force operating on a mass was determined by the position of all masses situated at a sufficiently small distance from the mass in question. Instead cf the space vector ?f, the velocity of matter, we shall introduce the space-time vector of the first kind w with the components.
Instead fX of the above expression for ds^ y we can also write a S d.v dx -" IX<T y fX V or according to (16) also in the form goo dx dx GENERALISED THEORY OF RELATIVITY 118 Now according to the rules of multiplication, of the fore- going paragraph, the magnitudes d^ ^q dx foims a co-variant four-vector, and in fact (on account of the arbitrary choice of dx ) any arbitrary four-vector. Instead of "the number corresponding to a position of the point", we shall say briefly, the co- ordinate of a point. Instead of .jg, we introduce in what follows the quantity .j - g, which is always real on account of the hyperbolic character of the space-time continuum.
Instead of Minkowski's space-time vector of the first kind, he uses the more expressive term ' four-vector,' thereby making ifc quite clear that it represents a directed quantity like a straight line, a force or a momentum, and has got 4 components, three in the direction of space-axes, and one in the direction of the time-axis. Instead of a model description of actual space-time events, it gives the probability distributions for possible meas? Instead of describing the structure of this c.s., we just ignored its existence. Instead of laws governing individuals, prob- ability laws appeared. Instead of minute apertures, there are extremely small obstacles formed by the atoms of the element, arranged very close to each other in absolutely regular order.
Instead of our previous model we may imagine that the magnet consists of very small elementary mag- netic dipoles which cannot be broken into separate poles. Instead of saying that some definite lines, some definite wave-lengths, belong to the spectrum of every atom, we can say that every atom has some definite energy levels, and that the emission of light quanta is associated with the transition of the atom from one energy level to another. Instead of stationing his com- panion at a distance he could have mounted there a mirror, which would automatically send back the signal immediately after receiving it.
Instead of that Herr Einstein has made statements, and in foreign countries at that, such as, coming from a man of world-wide reputation, were bound to be exploited and abused by the enemies not merely of the present German Government but of the whole German people. Instead of the artificial segregation of corpuscles belonging to various colours we have the natural difference in wave-length. Instead of the continuous, multi-coloured design of the sun's spectrum, bright, separated stripes appear on a continuous dark background. Instead of the equation (A) we then obtain the equation which corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocities in one direction according to the theory of relativity. Instead of two conservation laws we have only one, that of mass-energy.
Instead of which your testimony has served as a handle to the enemies not merely of the present Government but of the German people. Instead, we find light and dark rings. Instead, we have laws governing the changes in time of the probability. Institutions are in a moral sense im? Insuch a theory, singularities must certamly be excluded, since without such exclusion the differ? Insufficient consideration of this circumstance lies at the root of the difficulties which the electrodynamics of moving bodies at present encounters. InteJJ.igence makes clear to us the interrelation of means and ends. Integrate equation (47c) over a space section. Intelligence makes clear to us the interrelation of means and ends. Internationalism does not mean the surrender of individuality.
Interpretation of the Expression for the volume Dependence of the entropy of Monochromatic Radiation in Accordance with BoltzmannOs Principle In Sec. Interruption of intellectual training in the formative period of youth is very apt to leave a gap which can hardly be filled later. Inthis respect he is even further removed from the Russian and the Asiatic than the European is. Inthis time of decisions so heavy with fate what we must say to our fellow-citizens seems above all to be this: where belief in the omnipotence of physical force gets the upper hand in politica!
Inthis way it might perhaps be possible to establish a proper balance between production and consumption without tao great a limitation of free enterprise and at the same time to stop the intolerable tyranny of the owners of the means of pro? Intuition thus tells us that speed is essentially connected with action. Intuitively everyone seems to know the meaning of this sentence. Intuitively, we feel what is meant by this term. Invariants, however, are not the only forms by means of which we can give expression to the independence of the particular choice of the Cartesian co-ordinates. Inversely the latter can be grasped formally in satisfactory fashion only by way of the special theory of relativity.
Inview of this situati.on, it seems to be entirely justi:fiable seriously to consider the question as to whether the basis of field physics cannot by any means be put into harmony with the facts of the quantum theory. Involved in this assumption there are some which are rather less special, to which we must call attention on account of their fundamental significance. Is IT ADVISABLE for one who is not an expert on economie and social issues to express views on the subject of socialism? Is a beam of electrons a shower of elementary particles or a wave? Is human reason, then, without experience, merely by taking thought, able to fathom the properties of real things. Is it a shower of cor- puscles or a wave?
Is it advisable for one who is not an expert on economic and social issues to express views on the subject of socialism? Is it furnished by the metallic chips which are separated by the borer from the solid mass of metal? Is it instantaneous or momentary or does it, like other motion, require time? Is it justifable to set aside for a time the principles of indi? Is it not a proper subject far congratulation? Is it not a proper subject for congratulation? Is it not a terrible thing to be forced by the community to do things which every individual regards as abominable crimes? Is it not possible to replace the light-quanta hypothesis with another assumption, with which one could do justice to known phenomena?
Is it not significant that such men have been universally accepted as leaders, in spite of the fact that their efforts to mould the course of human affairs were attended with but small success? Is it not thinkable that Planck's radiation formula is correct, but that another derivation could be found that does not rest on such a seemingly monstrous assumption as Planck's theory? Is it not true that all the controversies and differences of opinion which we have touched upon in our strange exchange of letters are insig? Is it not true, however, that we have stumbled into a state of international affairs which tends to make every invention of our minds and every materia!good into a weapon and, consequently, into a danger far mankind?
Is it not, then, possible to regard the system of coordinates as at rest, and the centrifugal forces as gravitational? Is it permissible to consider the motion of only one body in the entire universe? Is it possible to imagine a spherical space? Is it really unavoidable that, because of our passions and our inherited customs, we should be condemned to annihilate each other so thoroughly that nothing would be lef t over which would deserve to be conserved? Is it sufficient to know what is observed in one c.s. Is it the right moment for this corporate sense to be awakened and strengthened? Is it to be found anywhere else under another name?
Is it true that the equations which express natural laws are co- variant in relation to Lorentz transformations only and not in relation to other transformations? Is light a wave or a shower of photons? Is my criticai reason so susceptible that the physiological change in my body during those ten years has been able to influence my concept of life so deeply? Is the choice of particular plants essential for the phenomenon? Is the ether carried with the room as the air was? Is the severe persecution to which conscientious objectors to military service are subjected to-day a whit less disgraceful to the community than those to which the martyrs of religion were exposed in former centuries?
Is the wave due to changes in the density of the medium, so that the oscillations of the particles are in the direction of the propagation? Is the wave theory also able to do this? Is there a Jewish Point of View? Is there a possibility of constructing a bridge between the new theory and observation? Is there a thinkable answer to this question of such a nature that the law of transmission of light in vacuo does not contradict the principle of relativity ? Is there a way out?It is easy to raise such questions, but difficult to answer them with any degree of assurance. Is there any sense then, you ask, in putting it? Is there no thinking ithout the use of language, namely in concepts and concept-combi?
Is there no thinking without the use of language, namely in concepts and concept-combinations for which words need not necessarily come to mind? Is this not the only basis which, consistently with today's possibility of mathematica] expression, can be adapted to the requirements of the gen? Is this principle also valid for non-mechanical phenomena, especially for those for which the field concepts proved so very important? Is this sentence true from the point of view of the relativity theory? Is what I have described a distinguishing mark of Judaism? Ishould run the risk of being taken for just an old hypocrite.
It 'is apparent that these four values, are determined by the vector 10 and inversely the vector it of magnitude SPECIAL LOEENTZ TRANSFORMATION 13 <i follows from the 4 values co^, 0)3, 003, w^ ; where (oji, W2J (^3) ai'6 real, ^'0)4 real and positive and condition (19) is fulfilled. It 1s clear that the system of equations is a consequence of the system , but not conversely. It allows one to see however to what extent the regularization of the hypersurfaces g=0 leads to a theoretical representation of matter, regarded from the standpoint of the original theory. It almost looks as if this domain, on which the fate of nations depends, had inevitably to be given over to violence and irresponsibility.
It also contains implicitly the photochemical principle of equivalence, as has been shown by me. It also has the special attraction in its favor that the way in which the Flettner rotors work remains a mystery to most lay- men, although they only involve the application of mechanical forces which every man believes himself to understand instinctively. It also is credible that an extensive use could be made of radioactivated gases which would spread over a wide region,. It also satisfies laws of conservation of momentum and energy, because we arrive at (13a) in place of (13) by introducing into Hamilton's principle, instead of the scalar of Riemann's tensor, this scalar increased by a universal constant and Hamilton's principle, of course, guarantees the validity of laws of conservation.
It also seeks to reduce the connections discovered to the smallest possible number of mutually independent conceptual elements. It also seemed to be a necessary consequence of the fact that light is capable of polarisation that this medium, the ether, must be of the nature of a solid body, because transverse waves are not possible in a fluid, but only in a solid. It also seemed to follow necessarily from the polarizability of light that this medium, the ether, must be of the na- ture of a solid body, because transverse waves are only possible in such a body and not in a fluid.
It also showed that Newtons law of motion was only to be regarded as a limiting law valid for small velocities ; in its place it set up a new law of motion in which the speed of light in vacuo figures as the critical velocity. It also turns out that for the removal of .the singularity it is not necessary to take the ponderable mass m positive. It always happens that some of the facts predicted by a theory are disproved by experiment. It appeared beyond question that light must be interpreted as a vibratory process in an elastic, inert medium filling up universal space. It appears less problematical to extend the ideas of practical geometry to spaces of cosmic order of magnitude.
It appears natural to choose this sign in such a way that the component 7'4' (in the limit of the special relativity theory) is always positive. It appears that the most natural electrical particle in the theory is one without gravitating mass. It appears that the systems K and are identical. It appears, therefore, as if there were Cartesian systems of co-ordinates, the so-called inertial systems, with reference to which the laws of mechanics (more generally the laws of physics) are expressed in the simplest form. It arose from Oersted's experiment on the deflection of a magnetic needle and led to the conclusion: a changing electric field is accompanied by a magnetic field.
It became clear that one arrives at a quite definite enlargement of the relativity theory if one postulates a principle of relativity in this extended sense. It became clear that the reciprocal actions between bodies due to electric and magnetic forces were af- fected, not by forces operating instantaneously at a distance, but by processes which are propagated through space at a finite speed. It became clear that there existed in free space conditions which propagated themselves in waves, as well as localized fields which were able to exert force on electrical masses or magnetic poles brought to the spot.
It became clear that to speak of the simultaneity of two events had no meaning except in relation to a given co-ordinate system, and that the shape of measuring devices and the speed at which clocks move depend on their state of motion with respect to the co-ordinate system. It became evident that a statement of the coincidence of two events could bave meaning only in connection with a system of coordinates, that the mass of bodies and the rate of movement of clocks must depend on their state of motion with regard to the coordinates. It becomes much clearer in the special case in which vectors (i) and (2) have the same direc- tion. It becomes smaller when the distance increases. It began as something placed between the source and the magnetic needle in order to describe the acting force.
It behaves like a wave when diffracted by a crystal. It behooves us at such a moment to remember this brilliant 'genius, who determined the course of western thought, research and practice to an extent that nobody before or since his time can touch. It can also be fully expressed mathematically by a symmetrical tensor of the second rank, the energy-tensor. It can be briefly remarked here that the following important law follows easily from the equations developed in the present section :if an electrically charged body moves in any manner in space, and if its charge does not change thereby, when regarded from a system moving along with it, then the charge remains constant even when it is regarded from the stationary system K. 10. It can be described by connecting the c.s.
It can be reached only when necessary guarantees of law and enforcement obtain everywhere, so that military security is no longer the problem of any single state. It can be regarded as a curved space in which the two " counter-points " are identical (indistinguishable from each other). It can be said, but cannot be thought. It can be shown that the kinetic theory of gases is not only in agreement with experiment, but actually leads to a more profound understanding of the facts. It can be used for strengthening that feeling of mutual friendship which so easily turns into mistrust and enmity. It can claim validity only for so-called ..fuertial systems".
It can easily be seen that all the valuable achievements, material, spiritual, and mora!, whicb we receive from society bave been brought abou t 14 IDEAS ANO Ol'INIONS in the course of countless generations by creative individuals. It can easily be shown that the square root of the mean of the squares of the total displacements of the particles has the value &J3 . It can only be achieved by understanding. It can only be got rid of by means of a physics which is conformable to the general principle of relativity, since the equations of such a theory hold for every body of reference, whatever may be its state of motion.
It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreduciblebasic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrenderthe adequaterepresentationof a singledatumof experience. It cannot be denied, however, that the suggestions of the American Government with regard to atomic weapons represented at least an attempt towards the creation of a supranational security organization. It cannot be doubted that the world crisis and the su:ffering and privations of the people resulting from the crisis are in some measure responsible for the dangerous upheavals of which we are the witness.
It cannot be my task today to act as judge of the conduct of a nation which for many years has considered me as her own; perhaps it is an idle task to judge in times when action counts. It cannot be ruled out that, in such a theory, the entire energy of the electromagnetic field could be viewed as localized in these singularities, just like the old theory of action-at-a-distance. It certainly led to no advance in the theory of gravitation or in physics generally to begin with, so that people got into the habit of treating Newtons law of force as an irreducible axiom. It certainly makes more sense to ask which institutions and traditions are harmful, and which are useful, to human beings; which make lif e happier, or more painful.
It clearly failed to do justice to the most fundamental property of gravitation. It combined all the advantages of classic Maxwellian theory together with an electronic hypothesis. It comes about, therefore, that precisely among the heretics of all ages we find men who were inspired by this highest religious experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as atheists, but sometimes also as saints. It compelled Newton to in- vent a physical space in relation to which acceleration was supposed to exist. It compels them to go in far dumping and so hanns the creditor-nations tao. It concerns the relationship of the individua!to society. It concerns the relationship of the individual to society.
It contains the recognition that the association of an electric field, changing in time, with a magnetic field is essential for our further argu- ment. It contains the two fluids, positive and negative, in equal amounts. It could be objected that eqs. It demands the highest possible standard of rigorous precision in the description of relations, such as only the use of mathematical language can give. It depends on the direction, which we shall define in the usual way by means of the angle <p' with the X'-axis and the angle ip' which the projection in the Y'Z'-plane makes with the Y'axis. It directs its ( + ) pole toward the North Pole, that is, toward the (-) magnetic pole of the earth. It does not matter to me whether or not the light source moves in my c.s.
It does not matter what intermediate processes give rise to this final result. It does not take into account the reaction of the "moved" materiai points on the gravitational field, nor does it consider how the centrai mass produces this gravitational field. It does not tell us the position and velocity of the electron at any moment because such a question has no sense in quantum physics. It exists because this bombardment is not uniform from all sides and cannot be averaged out, owing to its irregular and haphazard character. It exists only mathematically for him. It expresses the most extreme generalisation of Maxwell's velocitydistribution law. It followed from (1) and (2) that the weight of a sys- tem depends in a precisely known manner on its total energy.
It follows directly from this discussion, that for our sphere-beings the circumference of a circle first increases with the radius until the " circumference of the universe " is reached, and that it thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for still further increasing values of the radius. It follows from the Lorentz transformation that a stick would shrink to nothing if its speed were to reach that of light. It follows from the fundamental relation s2 = x12 + x22 + x32 (13) that the members of such a space-lattice are all of unit length. It follows from the invariance of ds2 for an arbitrary choice of the dx?, in connexion with the condition of symmetry consistent with (55), that the g?
It follows from the theory that an electron moving with a velocity of, say, 10,000 miles per second, has a wave-length which can be easily calculated, and which turns out to lie in the same region as the X-ray wave-lengths. It follows from these results that to an observer approaching a source of light with the velocity c, this source of light must appear of infinite intensity. It follows from this equation that from a composition of two velocities which are less than c, there always results a velocity less than c. For if we set v = c ? It follows from this relation and the one previously found that ? It follows from this that our notions of physical reality can never be final. It follows from this that the A?
It follows from this that the spectral lines in the light coming to us from the surfaces of big stars should appear shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. It follows from what has been said, that closed spaces without limits are conceivable. It follows from what has gone before, that coordinates with respect to an inertial system are physically defined by means of measurements and constructions with the aid of rigid bodies. It follows in fact from (9) remembering (14) A"^ = -^ I A'^*'=: - ~ A^^^ A^"^ y. V /A. It follows in fact from (9), when (14) is taken into consider? It follows that Newton's experiments on the dispersion of light can be described in two different languages, that of the corpuscular theory and that of the wave theory.
It follows that a value of u and a value of v belong to every point on the surface of the table. It follows that even if a radiant source S move with a velocity ?/, it should always remain the centre of spherical waves expanding outwards with velocity c. At first sight, it may not appear clear why the velocity should remain constant. It follows that only those points for which (I'- f42 correspond to points for which (1) is the metric. It follows, therefore, that Ix, Iy, Iz, iE form a 4-vector. It further follows from (16) that o is also a tensor, which we may call the mixed fundamental tensor. It gives me great pleasure to see before me Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, to whose view of life I am particularly attracted. It gives me great pleasure, indeed, to see the stub?
It had been determined by Roemer much earlier, though less accurately, by astronomical observation. It has a significance which is as independent of the system of co-ordinates as that of a straight line, as will appear in the sequel. It has been assumed that all these clocks go at the same rate if they are of identical construction. It has been clearly proclaimed that we are not seeking to create a political society, but that our aim is, in accordance with the old tradition of Jewry, a cultural one in the widest sense of the word. It has been emphasized that we must distinguish between the motion of the particles and that of the wave itself, which is a state of the medium.
It has been said very justly that Gr34co-Europeo-American culture as a whole, and in particular its brilliant flowering in the Italian Renaissance, which put an end to the stagnation of medi34val Europe, is based on the liberation and comparative isolation of the individual. It has been shown in the historical introduction how this is entirely at variance with the observed optical facts. It has existed ever since Euler and Bernulli determined the funda- mental laws of the frictionless motion of liquids. It has given rise to a revival of Jewish community life of which the generation before the last would never have dreamed. It has interesting consequences.
It has led to a formal clari:G.cation of Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic field; in particular it has led to an understanding of the es? It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one. It has not become a generally recognized axiom that the giant armaments of all nations are proving highly injurious to them collectively. It has often happened in physics that an essential advance was achieved by carrying out a consistent analogy between apparently unrelated phenomena. It has rightly been said that the very basis of Graeco? It has shown how the law of motion must be modi? It has thereby deliberately aban? It has thereby deliberately abandoned its function of giving moral support to the national minorities in their struggle against cultural oppression.
It has to be done bere because it is our only chance of getting such things said; our training in objectivity has led to a tabu on everything persona!, which we mortals may only transgress on quite exceptional occasions such as this. It has to be done here because it is one's only chance of getting such things said; since our training in objectivity has led to a taboo on everything personal, which we mortals may transgress only on quite exceptional occasions such as the present one. It has to be kept in mind that our formulae cannot be applied to extremely low temperatures, because in their derivation we have assumed that the vary only by a relatively infinitesimally small amount when s varies by 1.
It has to be proved that the symmetry thus d efined is a property which is independent of the system of reference. It has to be required that the mean kinetic energy of a molecule (per degree of freedom) should be equal to \kT in a Planck radiation field of temperature T. This requirement should hold independently of the nature of the molecules under consideration and independently of the frequencies emitted or absorbed by them. It has to make a certain detour round the cylinder C, in the course of which it passes A and B at the same velocity. It has unified the laws of conservation of momentum and of energy into one single law and has demonstrated the equivalence of mass and energy.
It has, of course, been known since the days of the ancient Greeks that in order to describe the movement of a body, a second body is needed to which the move- ment of the first is referred. It has, therefore, no reason to regret Einstein's withdrawal. It helped us to understand old facts and led us to new ones. It i;:; not until we have formulated these that we simplify their e1'pression by a particular choice of the system of reference. It illustrates the great advantage of using a c.s. It immediately demanded an explanation. It implies : the production ences.
It is "society" which provides man with food, clothing, a home, the tools of work, language, the forms of thought, and most of the content of thought; his life is made possible through the labor and the accomplishments of the many millions past and present who are all hidden behind the small word "society." It is a case of all or nothing. It is a community of moral tradition, which has always shown its strength and vitality in times of stress. It is a creation of the human mind, with its freely invented ideas and concepts. It is a different matter when the distance has to be judged from the railway line.
It is a difficult task; for it has, alas, to be admitted that at least in the countries with which I am most closely acquainted the artists and men of learning are governed by narrowly nationalist feelings to a far greater extent than the men of affairs. It is a familiar fact to readers of detective fiction that a false clue muddles the story and postpones the solution. It is a generous act on tbe part of tbe French government and as such deserves the thanks of al!. It is a generous act on the part of the French nation and deserves the thanks of all. It is a hypothesis about the physical nature of the continuum consid^iieJ, and also a pre-establislied rule for tiie choice of co-ordinates.
It is a matter of faith that nature story goes on until we have arrived at a as she is perceptible to our five senses takes the character of such a well system of the greatest conceivable unity, and of the greatest poverty of concepts formulated puzzle. It is a measure for the OdegeneracyO of the gas. It is a mistake often made in this country to measure things by the amount of money they cost. It is a precarious undertaking to say anything reliable about aims and intentions. It is a simple apparatus consisting essentially of two leaves of gold foil hanging from the end of a short piece of metal. It is a strange coincidence that nearly all the fundamental work concerned with the nature of heat was done by non-professional physicists who regarded physics merely as their great hobby.
It is a tedious and elaborate path which leads to the generalization of Galileo's clue. It is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business without getting into the greatest difficulties. It is a very high goal which, with our weak powers, we can reach only very inadequately, but which gives a sure founda? It is a widespread error that the special theory of rela- tivity is supposed to have, to a cer- tain extent, first discovered, or at any rate, newly introduced, the four- dimensionality of the physical con- tinuum. It is a work of such consistency, lucidity, and beauty as has only rarely been attained in an empirica!science. It is advantageous, however, for the theory, to choose only those processes concerning which we know something certain.
It is again an idealized experiment performed in imagination by repeating Faraday's ex- periment with a circuit shrinking to a point. It is agreed on all hands that the only principle which could serve as the basis of quantum theory would be one that constituted a transaton of the :field theory into the scheme of quantum stabsbcs. It is all within the nature of research and it is not at all sad. It is also an attempt to base the moral law on fear, a regrettable and discreditable attempt. It is also applicable to non-Euclidean continua, but only when, with respect to the defined "size" or "distance," small parts of the continuum under consideration behave more nearly like a Euclidean system, the smaller the part of the continuum under our notice.
It is also clear that the desire to arrive finally at logically connected concepts is the emotional basis of this rather vague play with the above-men? It is also clear that the solid body and the clock do not in the conceptual edifice of physics play the part of irreducible elements, but that of composite structures, which may not play any independent part in theoretical physics. It is also measured by the weight of the body ( heavy mass ). It is also proved there, by application of the theorem of moments to an infinitely small parallelepipedon, that p?? It is also to the pressure of this economically dominant minority that we owe. It is also vital to a valuable education that independent criti? '
It is also well known to geographers that the rivers of the northern hemisphere tend to erode chiefly on the right side. It is always a good excuse to ascribe the bad results of electrostatic experiments to the humidity of the air, which increases its conductivity. It is always simpler and better to think of a c.s. It is always to be borne in mind that sicc/i a * atliemaiical (lefinition has a physical senses only lohen loe have a clear )iotio7i of what is meant by time. It is an easy and grateful task to rejoice and praise and say nothing about the things one regrets or disapproves of. It is an easy and grateful task to rejoice and prase and to say notbing about tbe thngs one regrets or disapproves of.
It is an illegal struggle, but a struggle for people's real rights against their governments in so far as the latter demand criminal acts of the citizen. It is an irony of fate that I myself have been the recipient of excessive admiration and respect from my fellows through no fault, and no merit, of my own. It is an irony of fate that I myself have been the recipient of excessive admiration and reverence from my fellow-beings, tbrough no fault, and no merit, of my own. It is an open question whether or not this effect exists, and at the present time (1920) astronomers are working with great zeal towards the solution. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this.
It is apparent that the development of political relations in the year which has elapsed since the conclusion of the sec? It is apparent that the visible Brownian motion depends on the size of the invisible bombarding molecules. It is as if a man must pay himself a commission in francs for changing dollars to pounds, the commission money also being saved so that the sum of dollars, pounds, and francs is a fixed amount according to some defiYiite exchange rate. It is as if two independent causes were working to produce variations in the radiation pressure.
It is as the representative of the German-speaking academic world and in particular the Prussian Academy of Sciences, but above ali as a pupil and affectionate admirer that I stand at the grave of the greatest and noblest man of our times. It is as though a man who is fabulously rich should never spend or give away a cent; no one could tell how rich he was. It is assumed in pre-relativity physics that the laws of the configuration of ideal rigid bodies are consistent with Euclidean geometry. It is at last beginning to be realized that great wealth is not necessary for a happy and satisfactory !ife. It is at last beginning to be realized that great wealth is not necessary for a happy and satisfactory life.
It is at once apparent that this result still holds good if the clock moves from A to B in any polygonal line, and also when the points A and B coincide. It is best to represent all we know about the acting forces by a drawing, or rather by a spatial model, with lines of force. It is beyond question closely akin to that which has possessed the religious geniuses of all ages. It is by no means necessary that a concept must be connected with a sensorily cognizable and reproducible sign (word); but when this is the case thinking becomes by means of that fact communicable. It is by no means negligible; it is completely dominant in the regime where Wien's radiation formula holds. It is by no means settled a priori that a limiting transition of this kind has any possible mean?
It is called so because at any given moment all points on any sphere surrounding the source behave in the same way// Let us consider a portion of such a sphere at a great distance from the source. It is certainly more satisfying to have the story follow a rational pattern. It is certainly true that the observer in the railway carriage experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the application of the brake, and that he recognises, in this the non-uniformity of motion (retardation) of the carriage. It is characteristic of such a situation that individuals feel indifferent or even hostile toward the group, small or large, to which they belong.
It is characteristic that the animals were expressly included in the command to keep holy the Sabbath day, so strong was the feeling that the ideal demands the solidarity of all living things. It is clear also that "serving God" was equated with "serving the living." It is clear from our previous considerations that the (special) theory of relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. It is clear from this picture presented by the kinetic theory that to keep the piston in this lower position more weight is re- quired. It is clear that (26) and (24) concern only special cases of extension (the extensior, of the tensors of rank one and zero respectively).
It is clear that Gauss co-ordinates are nothing more than an association of two sets of numbers with the points of the surface considered, of such a nature that numerical values differing very slightly from each other are associated with neighbouring points " in space." It is clear that a physical theory which satisfes this postulate will also be suitable for the genera! It is clear that a physics which satisfies this postulate will be unobjectionable from the standpoint of the general relativity postulate. It is clear that all equations of the absolute differential calculus can be written in a form free from denominators, whereby the tensors are re- placed by tensor densities of suitable weight.
It is clear that all the valuable things, material, spiritual, and moral, which we receive from society can be traced back through countless generations to certain creative individuals. It is clear that during this moment the stick will turn, so that it will no longer be displaced parallel to its original position. It is clear that he was enmeshed in a traditional prejudice from which, despite his extraordinary intellect, he could not free himself. It is clear that not only velocities themselves but also their changes are vectors. It is clear that similar results hold about stationary bodies in a stationary system when considered from a uniformly moving system. It is clear that the concept of space as a real thing already existed in the extra-scientific conceptual world.
It is clear that the part which has reached the glass will travel with the velocity of light in glass, while the other still moves with the velocity of light in ether. It is clear that the same results hold good of bodies at rest in the OstationaryO system, viewed from a system in uniform motion. It is clear that the system of concepts of axiomatic geometry alone cannot make any assertions as to the relations of real objects of this kind, which we will call practically-rigid bodies. It is clear that the system of concepts of axiomatic geometry alone cannot make any assertions as to the relations of real objects of this kind, which we will call practicallyrigid bodies.
It is clear that there can be some point in a statistical method of reasoning only when the system consists of a large number of individuals. It is clear that this definition can be used to give an exact meaning not only to two events, but to as many events as we care to choose, and independently of the positions of the scenes of the events with respect to the body of reference 1) (here the railway embankment). It is clear that this problem could be worked out satisfactorily only if the particles could be inter? It is clear that this proposition at once shows the covariant character with respect to a Lorentz-group. It is clear that two such dipoles would behave exactly like the bar magnets in experiment i . It is clear that we have the problem of Section 6 again before us.
It is clever, well observed, bonest; it stands on its own feet up to a point, and yet it is so typically feminine, by wbicb I mean derivative and steeped in persona! It is clever, well observed, honest, it stands on its own feet up to a point, and yet it is so typically feminine, by which I mean derivative and vitiated by personal rancour. It is clfear that at this moment (^= 0) the .electron is at rest relative to the system A-, which moves parallel to the X-axis with the constant velocity v. From the suppositions made above, in combination with the principle of relativity, it is clear that regarded from the system k, the electron moves according to the equations dr^ dT^ ' dT" in the time immediately following the moment, where the symbols (^, 77, I, t, X', Y', Z') refer to the system A'.
It is common knowledge that, with the advance of modern science, this issue has come to mean a matter of life and death for civilisation as we know it ; nevertheless, for all the zeal displayed, every attempt at its solution has ended in a lamentable breakdown. It is comparatively simple to keep the school free from this worst of ali evils. It is completely determined by its "metric" property: Let dxo, dyo, dzo, dto be the coordinate differences of two infinitesimally near points ( events ); then (1) ) ds2 = dxo2 + dyo2 +dzo2 - c2dto2 is a measurable quantity which is independent of the special choice of the inertial system. It is conceptually possible to imagine velocities greater than that of light, but such velocities cannot occur in reality.
It is confounding the quantity of heat in different bodies with its general strength or intensity, though it is plain that these are two different things, and should always be distinguished, when we are thinking of the distribution of heat. It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man strength of this sort. It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength. It is customary to express the equivalence of mass and energy ( though somewhat inexactly ) by the formula E = mc2, in which e represents the velocity of light, about 186,000 miles per second. It is definitely a mechanical concept. It is deliberately that I choose here the concept of number, because it belongs to pre-scientific think?
It is deliberately that I choose here the concept of number, because it belongs to pre-scientific thinking and because, in spite of that fact, its constructive character is still easily recognizable. It is difficult to begin by answering these questions clearly and convincingly. It is difficult to evince enthusiastic interest in these simple and naive experiments. It is difficult to get rid of deep-rooted prejudices, but there is no other way. It is due to this fact that, according to the theory of relativity, the " time "x4, enters into natural laws in the same form as the space co ordinates x1, x2, x3. It is easily realized that it takes longer to swim to a point 50 yards up-stream and back than to a point 50 vards acioss-stream and back.
It is easily seen that if in the process of magnetisation, a number of electrons be set into rotatory motion, then these will impart to the metal itself a turning couple. It is easily seen that the Lorentz transformation really satisfies equation (11) for _ = I; for (11) is a consequence of (8a) and (9), and hence also of (8) and (9). It is easily seen that the three-dimensional spherical space is quite analogous to the twodimensional spherical surface. It is easy to find a superficial analogy which really expresses nothing. It is easy to follow in the sacred writings of the Jewish people the development of the religion of fear into the moral religion, which is carried further in the New Testament.
It is easy to say that the individuai cannot be held responsible for acts carried out under irresistible compulsion, because the individuai is APHORISMS FOR LEO BAECK 27 fully dependent upon the society in which he is living and there? It is easy to show that n=z -{ (0. It is easy to verify that the field equations (outside the mass) are satisfied to the first reder of small quantities. It is easy to verify that this solution satisfies approximately the field-equation outside the mass M. Let us now investisrate the infiuences which the field of mass M will have upon the metrical properties of the field. It is equally important here to distinguish between electric potential and electric charge.
It is essential for our point of view that we can arrive at these constructions and the laws relating them one with another by adhering to the principle of searching for the mathematically simplest concepts and their connections. It is essential for the solution of this problem to know whether light waves in the ether are longitudinal or transverse. It is essential for these considerations to assume that the behaviour of the measuring rods does not depend upon the history of their previous motion. It is essential here also to pay strict attention to the relation of experience to our concepts. It is essential here, as always in science, to rid ourselves of deep-rooted, often uncritically repeated, prejudices.
It is essential in our arrangement that these signals travel with the velocity of light, the velocity which plays such a fundamental role in the theory of relativity. It is essential that tbe student acquire an understanding of and a lively feeling far values. It is essential to have time defined by means of stationary clocks in the stationary system, and the time now defined being appropriate to the stationary system we call it Othe time of the stationary system. It is essential to note that this definition of time relates only to the inertial system K, since we have used a system of clocks at rest relatively to K. The assumption which was made in the pre-relativity physics of the absolute character of time (i.e.
It is essential to observe now that the local orthog- onal n-legs are not completely determined by the metric. It is essential, however, that we make use only of such concepts concerning whose coordination to our experience we feel no doubt. It is evident in this way that the moment of a vector is not a vector but a tensor. It is evident that according to Newtonian Mechanics, this covariance holds for c=^oo^ and not for c*=volocity of Hght. It is evident that in the Euclidean geometry only such, and all such, quantities have an objective significance, independent of the particular choice of the Cartesian co-ordinates, as can be expressed by an invariant with respect to linear orthogonal transformations. It is evident that this distance will not depend on the medium alone.
It is evident that this equation is identical with the one obtained in Sec. It is evident, therefore, that the dependence of the indi? It is evident, therefore, that the dependence of the individual upon society is a fact of nature which cannot be abolishedNjust as in the case of ants and bees. It is exactly the same as when a stone is allowed to fall from the top of a tower. It is expressed even in the work of the Atomists. It is f urther to be assumed that in the space-time terntory under consideration the g,,.. at spatial infinity, with a suitable choice of co-ordinates, tend toward the values (4) ; i.e. It is first necessary to show that the form (47a) is equivalent to equations (47). It is for this reason that of late we have had to witness re?
It is for this reason that the critical think? It is for this reason that the critical thinking of the physicist cannot possibly fact that, in our thinking (which deter be restricted to the examination of the mines our expectation), we attribute to cannot proceed without considering critically a much more difficult problem, the problem of analyzing the nature of everyday thinking. It is for this reason that we have been in the habit of treating time as an independent continuum. It is found by calculation, however, that a slightly different time T1 is required for this process, if the body, together with the mirrors, be moving relatively to the 34ther. It is found moreover that among the relative positions, there is one of a specifc kind which we designate as Contact.
It is from this point of view that I would have you look at the Zionist movement. It is gratifying that men should feel an urge to proclaim this in an official way. It is greater than the standard velocity of light in the direction of the mo- tion of the room and smaller in the opposite direction. It is greater than the standard velocity of sound in the direction of the motion of the room and smaller in the opposite direction. It is hard necessity and not speculation or a desire for novelty which forces us to change the old classical view.
It is hardly necessary to add, that anything which any insulated body, or system of bodies, can continue to furnish without limitation, cannot possibly be a material substance] and it appears to me to be extremely difficult, if not quite im- possible, to form any distinct idea of anything, capable of being excited and communicated, in the manner the Heat was excited and communicated in these Experiments, except it be MOTION. It is hardly possible to give a negative answer to tbis question. It is imaginable that another set of suppositions, a theory of entirely different character, would work just as well and give all the required explanations. It is immaterial what kind of processes one chooses for such a definition of time.
It is important for our further considerations to realize the possibility of a different kind of wave, called transverse. It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product. It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product.Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. It is impossible here to use the previous analogy of money unless it is somehow generalized.
It is impossible in the latter case also, to introduce co-ordinates on a surface (e.g. It is impossible to imagine one without the other because matter demonstrates its existence as a source of force by its action on other matter. It is impossible to reconcile these two ideas. It is impossible to reconcile this fact with the classical transformation. It is impossible, however, to divide science into separate and unrelated sections. It is impossible, on the basis of quantum physics, to describe positions and velocities of an elementary particle or to predict its future path as in classical physics. It is impossible, therefore, to apply methods and meas?
It is in general one of the essentiaHeatures of the theory of relativity that it is at pains to work out the relations between general concepts and empirical facts more precisely. It is in no way known how this incongruity is to be overcome. It is in this knowledge that the university courses are being instituted, with the object not merely of preparing these young people for a profession but of stimulating them to intellectual activity as such. It is in this sense that the following observa? It is in this sense that the world of our sense logically from them) and partially prop ositions not derivable from the defini experiences is comprehensible. It is in this spirit that I should like to ask my Russian colleagues and any other reader to accept the following answer to their Ietter.
It is indeed possible to imagine that the old concepts are unsuited to the de- scription of general motion, and that new ones must be created. It is inevitable, considering the progressive centralization of production, that the economie and the political struggle should become more and more closely interwoven, the politica!factor continually growing in significance in the process. It is just as important to make knowledge live and to keep it alive as to solve specific problems. It is just the same in the case of space-measurements by means of measuring-rods, as a litttle consideration will show. It is just the same with the fundamental problems in science. It is justified in so far as it does make events understandable.
It is known that MaxwellOs electrodynamicsNas usually understood at the present timeNwhen applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. It is known that cathode rays and the so-called _-rays emitted by radioactive substances consist of negatively electrified particles (electrons) of very small inertia and large velocity. It is known that the path is a closed curve, called the ellipse. It is mainly a program, and faith in the possibility of its accom? It is merely a matter of convenience to choose a particular c.s. It is misleading to speak of the Christianization of the Jews or the Judaization of the Christians. It is more easily under- stood when the experiment is repeated many times.
It is most astonishing that the kinetic theory not only predicts the existence of such a universal number, but enables us to determine it. It is most easily described mathematically as follows: In the definite point P we suppose an orthogonal n-leg with definite, freely chosen orienta- tion. It is most essential, for a description of events, to know how to pass from one c.s. It is my conviction that pure mathematical construction enables us to discoverthe conceptsand the laws connectingthem which give us the key to the understanding of the phenomena of Nature. It is my firm conviction that once the psychological impediments are overcome the solution of the real problems will not be such a terribly difficult matter.
It is my opiuion that when we calculate the pondero- motive force which acts upon a unit volume at the space- time point ..", y, :, I, it has got, .c, y, :: components as the first three components of the space-time vector K + (a)K)aj, This vector is perpendicular to w ; the law of Energy finds its expression in the fourth relation. It is natural to assume that they too can be described as tensor-:6.elds of the type gik, which in generai do not admit a transformation to the form ( 1), ie, which do not satisfy the "Riemann condition," but weaker conditions, which, just as the Riemann condition, are independent of the choice of coordinates (ie, are generally invariant ).
It is natural to the tendency of mechanics to assume these material points, and the laws of forces acting between them, as invariable, since time alterations would lie outside of the scope of mechanical explanation. It is natural, therefore, that institutions which serve the interests of science should be a factor making for the union of nations and men. It is necessary for the elevation of society and no less so for renewing the strength of the intellectual worker; for the flower of science does not grow in the desert. It is necessary that conditions be established that guarantee the individuai state the right to solve its conHicts with other states on a legai basis and under intemational jurisdiction.
It is necessary that the individual state be prevented from making war by a supranational organization supported by a military power that is exclusively under its control. It is neither the point in space, nor the instant in time, at which something happens that has physical reality, but only the event itself. It is no accident that capitalism has brought with it progress not merely in production but also in knowledge. It is no easy task for me to overcome my inclination to a life of quiet contemplation. It is no exaggeration to say that the solu? It is no mere chance that our older universities have developed from clerical schools.
It is no use trying to convince the others of our spiritual and intellectual equality by arguments addressed to the reason, when their attitude does not originate in their intellects at all. It is no wonder that such schools are the rnle in Gertnany and Russia. It is not at all the same thing to increase by one foot per second a velocity of about 100 feet per second or a velocity approaching that of light. It is not clear what is to be understood here by "position" and "space." It is not difficult to realize that complicated chemical processes are taking place in the battery, processes in which the immersed copper and zinc, as well as the liquid itself, take active parts. It is not difficult to treat also the mixing of two different gases by the method explained here.
It is not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel constrained to call the propositions of geometry "true." It is not enough for us to play a part as individuals in the cultural development of the human race, we must also tackle tasks which only nations as a whole can perform. It is not even absolutely clear which concepts belong to the primary layer. It is not impossible that with bodies whose energy-content is variable to a high degree (e.g. It is not my business to draw up an indictment, but merely to explain my position. It is not my business to draw up an indictrnent but merely to explain my position. It is not my purpose in this discussion to represent the generai theory of relativity as a system that is as simple and logica! It is not part of our concept.
It is not surprising that Newton would not listen to a wave theory of light; for such a theory was most unsuited to his theoretical foundation. It is not the individual spectator's duty merely to wait and criticize. It is not unimaginable that human ingenuity will some day find methods which will make it possible to pro? It is noteworthy that in the derivation of this equation, from which one can easily obtain the law of Boyle and GayLussac as well as the analogous law of osmotic pressure thermodynamically,6 no assumption had to be made as to a law of motion of the molecules. It is now high time that we remedy this defect; but I would mention at the outset, that this matter lays no small claims on the patience and on the power of abstraction of the reader.
It is obvious and generally accepted that one could eliminate two more universal constants from physics by introducing, instead of the gram and the centimeter, properly chosen **nat- ural" units (for example, mass and radius of the electron) . It is obvious that the danger of such deterioration is more acute in a coun? It is obvious that we can here apply the consideration of the previous section, since the ray of light plays the part of the man walking along relatively to the carriage. It is of the utmost importance that this partial world government be very strong, comprising at Ieast two-thirds of the major industria!and economie areas of the world. It is on this account that our fundamental equations permit the idea of a spherical universe.
It is on this that those who are striving to improve the lot of man may ground their hopes: human beings are not condemned, because of their biologica! It is on this that those who are striving to improve the lot of man may ground their hopes: human beings are not condemned, because of their biological constitution, to annihilate each other or to be at the mercy of a cruel, self-inflicted fate.If we ask ourselves how the structure of society and the cultural attitude of man should be changed in order to make human life as satisfying as possible, we should constantly be conscious of the fact that there are certain conditions which we are unable to modify.
It is one of the great realizations of Immanuel Kant that the postulation of a real exter tions of science become general state ments about complexes of sense experi nal world would be senseless without We shall call "primary concepts" such this comprehensibility. It is one of the great realizations of Immanuel Kant that the setting up of a real external world would be senseless without this comprehensibility. It is one of those fundamental difficulties which, once formulated, must lead, in the long run, to scien- tific progress. It is only a matter of adopting a convention, and no significance can be attached to the choice, for we know no method of deciding the question experimentally. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that mankind constitutes even now a planetary com?
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that mankind constitutes even now a planetary community of production and consumption. It is only determined more closely by specifying laws which the metrical field of the g/xv satisfy. It is only in the case in which positive answers may be given to both of these questions, that the concepts of the theory may be said to be satis- factory. It is only men who are free, who create the inventions and in? It is only possible when sufficiently small regions of the continuum under consideration may be regarded as Euclidean continua. It is only to the individuai that a soul is given. It is only when there is numerical equality between the inert and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of the nature of the body.
It is only when very small obstacles and apertures are used that light reveals its wave-like nature. It is only with reluctance that mans desire for knowledge endures a dualism of this kind. It is open to every man to choose the direction of bis striving; and also every man may draw com? It is our aim in these last pages to characterize the principal ideas of this theory. It is our aim, in the following pages, to describe in broad outline that work of physicists which corre- sponds to the pure thinking of the investigator. It is our intention to draw conclusions from (1) and (2), see where and how these assumptions contradict the classical transformation, and find the physical meaning of the results obtained.
It is our sacred duty; for they are sacrificing themselves for the soul and the repute of the entire Jewish people. It is owing to this circumstance that classical mechanics was able to establish successfully the conservation of mass as a law of independent validity. It is owing to this, that as regards the physical nature of matter (in a narrow sense) no definite necessary assump- tions are to be introduced. It is plain that this inde- pendence, which is a principle condition of the use- fulness of framing purely geometrical concepts, is not necessary a priori. It is possible and advantageous to regard vectors as tensors of rank 1, and invariants (scalars) as tensors of rank 0. It is possible that for different phenomena this dependence is different.
It is possible that the friction changes the specific heat of the wood and not the total amount of heat." It is possible that the movements to be discussed here are identical with the so-called Brownian molecular motion ; however, the information available to me regarding the latter is so lacking in precision, that I can form no judgment in the matter (I). It is possible to be a civilized European and a good citizen and at the same time a faithful Jew who loves his race and honours his fathers. It is possible to do these things, but not on the basis of our initial clue alone, for it is now necessary to know not only the direction of the force but also its absolute value its magnitude.
It is possible to find general formulations for the behaviour of the g,.. at infnity which express the essentials of the question without further restrictive assumptions. It is possible to find out how great or, rather, how small the wave-length must be to pro- duce a particular pattern. It is postulated that the system of equations expressing the laws of pre-relativity physics is covariant with respect to the transformation (3), as are the relations of Euclidean geometry. It is precisely because I desire to work with ali my might for the establishment of an intemational arbitrating and regula?
It is precisely because I desire to work with all my might for the establishment of an international arbitrating and regulative authority superior to the State, and because I have this object so very much at heart, that I feel compelled to leave the Commission. It is quite a different matter if we use the field language and again trust our principle that the action is determined by the field. It is quite clear that in view of its enormous mag- nitude, the velocity of light could be measured only by taking distances comparable to that between the earth and another planet of the solar system or by a great refinement of experimental technique. It is quite clear that some of the laws of nature must be different in this c.s., otherwise the phrase "motion through ether" would be meaningless.
It is quite clear to me that the religious paradise of youth, which was thus lost, was a first attempt to free myself from the chains of the "merely-personal," from an existence which is dominated by wishes, hopes, and primitive feelings. It is quite differ- ent with weighing. It is quite possible that the relative strength of these two drives is, in the main, fixed by inheritance. It is rather a standpoint from which all questions which arise inlife could and should be judged. It is rather difficult to give a detailed, and consistent chronological account of his scientific activities,they are so variegated, and cover such a wide field. It is really our whole system of guesses which is to be either proved or disproved by experiment.
It is required by the law of propagation of light, in conjunction with the postulate of relativity, that the transmission of the signal in question should take place N as judged from K1 N in accordance with the corresponding formula r' = ct' or, x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c2t'2 = 0 . It is right in principle that those should be the best loved who have contributed most of the elevation of the human race and human life. It is safe to assume that both rods are of infinite length and have initial points but no end-points. It is senseless to recount here the details which all show that nothing has been done in order to alleviate Russia's distrust, a distrust which can very well be understood in the light of the events of the last decades and to whose origin we have contributed no little.
It is shown, however, that the conviction to the effect that the field theory is unable to give, by its methods, a solution of these problems rests upon prejudice. It is something like this: The body (e.g. It is something that may be felt intuitively more easily than rationally compre? It is specially true for the tensor B , which plays a fundamental role in the theory. It is still less satisfactory because it leads to the result that the light emitted by the stars and also individual stars of the stellar system are perpetually passing out into infinite space, never to return, and without ever again coming into interaction with other objects of nature. It is su:fficient-as far as we know-for the representation of the observed facts of celestial me?
It is sufficient now to note the birth of this particular mem- ber. It is supplied by accepting the fundamental assumptions (1) and (2), and, strange though it seems, giving up (3). It is symptomatic of the metamorphosis which that language has undergone. It is the aim of science to establish generai rules which determine the reciprocai connection of objects and events in time and space. It is the bounden duty of everyone to stand with every ounce of energy for the preservation and enhanceent of ese libeties and to exert all possible influence m keeping public opinion aware of the existing danger. It is the cause of wars and every kind of oppression, which fill the earth with pain, sighs, and bitterness.
It is the combination of the Law of Motion with the Law of Attraction which constitutes that marvelous edifice of thought which makes it possible to calculate the past and future states of a system from the state obtain- ing at one particular moment, in so far as the events take place under the influence of the forces of gravity alone. It is the cosmic religious sense which grants this power. It is the direction of the so-called tangent. It is the duty of every man of good will to strive steadfastly in his own little world to make this teaching of pure humanity a living force, so far as he can. It is the expression of a painf ul solitude and isolation from which so many people are suffering in these days.
It is the expression of a painful solitude and isolation from which so many people are suffering in these days. It is the feeling from which true scientific research draws its spiritual sustenance, but which also seems to find expression in the song of birds. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. It is the grand object of all theory to make these irreducible elements as simple and as few in number as possible, without having to renounce the adequate representa- tion of any empirical content whatever. It is the hidden evil power behind the nationalism which is rampant everywhere.&hellip; Possibly something might be gained by nationalization.
It is the moral qualities of its leading personalities tbat )!AHATMA GANDHI 77 are perhaps of even greater significance for a generation and for the course of history than purely intellectual accomplish? It is the most important of all the guesses we have had to make so far. It is the only physical theory of universal content concerning which I am con- vinced that, within the framework of the applicability of its basic concepts, it will never be overthrown (for the special attention of those who are skeptics on principle). It is the privilege of man's moral genius, impersonated by inspired individuals, to advance ethical axioms which are so comprehensive and so well founded that men will accept them as grounded in the vast mass of their individuai emo?
It is the reply of a man who anxiously tries to :6.nd a feasible solution without having the illusion that he himself knows "the truth" or "the right path" to follow. It is the representation of an elemen- tary electrical particle without mass. It is the result of an extremely laborious process of adaptai:ion: hypothetical, never completely final, always subject to question and doubt. It is the same as the one I have already given for the force which acts on the Flet- tner cylinder in the wind; only the place of the cylinder C is taken by a cannon ball rotating about the vertical axis, and that of the wind by the relative motion of the air with reference to the flying cannon ball. It is the second question that we wish to consider here, as applied to quantum mechanics.
It is the security by which we are so much impressed in mathematics. It is the simplest plan to use the train itself as reference-body (co-ordinate system). It is the statement of a man who has striven in vain to attain an equilibrium within himseH and has more or less lost hope of succeeding. It is the statement of a man who has striven in vain to attain an equilibrium within himself and has more or less lost hope of succeeding. It is the velocity at which the corpuscles travel through empty space. It is then at onee seen that oo denotes the reciprocal matrix (Ol 180 PIUNCU'LE Oh' RELATIVITY frequent oeeurreuce in this paper, it will be better to form an idea of their geometrical meaning.
It is then concluded that after the measurement the first system is left in the state given by the wave function uh(x(), and that the second system is left in the state given by the wave function ph(x2). It is then possible to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part of space (world), relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in motion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion. It is then seen immediately that our basic equation (12) is identically satisfied. It is then very easy to go back to the general covariant equations, if it appears desirable in any special ease. It is there even in the absence of a magnetic pole to test its existence. It is therefare easy to see why the churches bave always faught science and persecuted its devotees.
It is therefore clear that Newton's mechanics does not really satisfy the requirement of causality in the case under consideration, but only apparently does so, since it makes the factitious cause R1 responsi ble for the ob? It is therefore clear that the average kinetic energy of a liquid particle is smaller than that of a corresponding gas particle. It is therefore easy to see why the Churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees. It is therefore evident that straight lines have a significance which is independent of the system of co-ordinates.
It is therefore possible, without loss of clearness, to leave off the summation sign ; so that we introduce the rule : wherever the index in any term of an expression appears twice, it is to be summed over all of them except when it is not oxpress- edly said to the contrary. It is therefore suflcient to give to the system a succession of discrete frequency values. It is these conclusions which must correspond with our separate experiences ; in any theoretical treatise their logical deduction occupies almost the whole book. It is these consequences to which our particularexperiencesare to correspond,and it is the logical derivation of them which in a purely theoretical work occupies by far the greater part of the book. It is they who have created tbe League of Nations.
It is they who have created the League of Nations. It is this cultural constitution which, with the passage of time, is subject to change and which determines to a very large extent the relationship between the individual and society. It is this department of science, with its ever-grow? It is this mythical, or rather this symbolic, content of the religious traditions which is Jikely to come into confiict with science. It is this that I feel so strongly m re- reading the words written in the past. It is this that primarily constitutes and preserves culture. It is this which is the mark of the boro teacher. It is thoroughly in keeping with the great and proud traditions of.
It is thus clear that the Newtonian mechanics does not, in the case treated here, actually fulfil the requirements of causality, but produces on the mind a fictitious com- placency, in that it makes responsible a wholly imaginaryi cause Ri for the different behaviours of the bodies S, and Sg which are actually observable. It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individua! It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights. It is thus impossible to explain the effect by picturing the path of an electron or a photon in the old classical way.
It is thus possible to introduce mathema- tically and rigorously the concepts of potential energy, depending on position, and kinetic energy, depending on velocity. It is thus possible to reduce all acoustical phenomena to mechanics by means of the wave concept. It is to be emphasized that the (generally covariant) laws of conservation (21) and (22) are deduced from the field equa? It is to be emphasized, however, that a positive curvature of space is given by our results, even if tb.e supplementary term is not introduced.
It is to be found rather in the fact of his recognition that the four-dimensional spacetime continuum of the theory of relativity, in its most essential formal properties, shows a pronounced relationship to the three-dimensional continuum of Euclidean geometrical space.1) In order to give due prominence to this relationship, however, we must replace the usual time co-ordinate t by an imaginary magnitude proportional to it. It is to be noted carefully that equations (8) or (5) would bave to give way to others, if we were to assume )1 or {') to be also dependent on derivatives of the %J of order higher than the first. It is to be noted that T44 is accordingly a positive quantity. It is to be noted that in the case of the solution.
It is to be noted that instead of the origin of the co-ordinates we might have chosen any other point for the point of origin of the ray, and the equation just obtained is therefore valid for all values of x0, y, z. It is to be noticed that instead of the origin of co- ordinates, we could select some other point as the exit point for rays of light, and therefore the above equation holds for all values of (0/^,2",^,). It is to be noticed that t is not a tensor ; on the other band (49) applies to ali systems of co-ordinates for which ,.j - g = 1.
It is to be remembered that only a modified mechanics will occur, in which the square root of this differential combination takes the place of time, so that cases in which the velocity is greater than c will play no part, something like imaginary coordinates in ofeometry. It is to measuring-bodies of this kind that statements as to rigid bodies must be referred. It is to such a possibility that we wish to call attention in the present paper in spite of the fact that we are not yet able to decide whether this theory can account for quantum phenomena. It is to you English fellow-Jews that we now appeal to help us in this great enterprise which splendid men have set on foot.
It is true that Mach tried to avoid having to accept as real something which is not observable by endeavouring to substitute in mechanics a mean acceleration with reference to the totality of the masses in the universe in place of an acceleration with reference to absolute space. It is true that Newton tried to reduce ligbt to the motion of materia! It is true that a supporter of this theory could invent arguments to account for it. It is true that convictions can best be supported with ex? It is true that convictions can best be supported with experi? It is true that even in everyday experience weight, which is in a sense action at a distance, plays a very important part.
It is true that the Maxwell-Lorentz field equations remain practically/ uncliauged by the Lorentz transforma- tion, but they arc changed to some sliglit extent. It is true that the equations of motion of the materia!point can be modified (and with them the expressions for momen? It is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in mechanics, but it had not been interpreted. It is true that this proposed physical interpretation of geometry breaks down when applied immediately to spaces of sub-molecular order of magnitude. It is true that this will not happen to the artist in his uniqueness. It is true that we have a League of Nations and a Court of Arbitration. It is undeniable that previous attempts to ensure peace have failed through aiming at inadequate compromises.
It is unthinkable, however, that na? It is usually the first thing about physics which we learn by heart in school, and some of us may remember it : Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. It is very difficult to elucidate this feeling to anyone who is entirely without it, es? It is very difficult to explain this feeling to anyone who is entirely without it, especially as there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it. It is very likely that the properties are so modified that an unchanged quan- tity of heat comes to produce a higher temperature than before.
It is very often convenient to perform certain optical experiments with homogeneous light, since, as we can well understand, the result will be much simpler. It is very probable that light seems to travel in straight lines only because its wave-length is very small in comparison with the size of ordinary obstacles and of apertures used in experiments. It is well known that if we attempt to apply Maxwell's electrodynamics, as conceived at the present time, to moving bodies, we are led to assymet ry which does not ao^ree with observed phenomena. It is well known that, with the help of this assumption, Herr Drude derived a theoretical expression for the ratio of thermal and electrical conductivities of metals.
It is well known, however, that this way of regarding the electromagnetic field leads to contradictions. It is well-known that according to Ampere, the magnetisation of iron and iron-like bodies, when placed within a coil carrying an electric current is due to the excitation in the metal of small electrical circuits. It is with this in mind that the League of Nations has created the Commission de coopZration intellectuelle. It is working indefatigably for the physical preservation of our economically heavily burdened people, while the Ort Society is striving to remove a social and economically burdensome wrong from which the Jewish people have suffered from the time of the Middle Ages.
It is worth our while to notice the difference be- tween determining the position of a point and the time of an event. It is worth our while to see just what his results were. It is worth pointing out that this metric field does not represent the whole Minkowski space but only part of it. It is worthy of remark that v and w enter into the expression for the resultant velocity in a symmetrical manner. It is wth this in mind that the League of Nations created tbe Commission de co-opration intellec? It is, as it were, a purely empirical enterprise. It is, for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference such that, as judged from it, the gravitational field of the earth (in its entirety) vanishes. It is, however, a useful concept which we shall need later.
It is, however, clear that science is fully justified in assigning such a numerical equality only after this numerical equality is reduced to an equality of the real nature of the two concepts. It is, however, impossible to be satisfied with an understanding of rectilinear motion alone. It is, however, not beyond us to imagine that the room moving with its light source carries the ether along with it just as the sound source and air were carried along in the closed room. It is, however, well confirmed experimentally for large values of ?/T. It is, however, well known that this way of looking at the matter leads to contradictions.
It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wrack and ruin without fail. It is, in this sense, a dualistic theory and does not bring our old problem of reducing everything to the field con- cept even one step nearer realization. It is, indeed, di:fficult to imagine how these loans will ever be repaid. It is, indeed, the attitude of the Soviet Government, that was partly negative and partly dilatory, which has made it so di:fficult for well-meaning people in this country to use their politica!
It is, moreover, this working class alone that has it in its power to establish healthy relations with the Arabs, which is the most important political task of Zionism. It is, of course, universally agreed that science has to establish connections between the facts of ex- perience, of such a kind that we can predict further occurrences from those already experienced. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research. It is, therefore, contrary to common sense to speak about the motion of only one body. It is, therefore, inconvenient to have only one clock. It is, therefore, quite natural that the churches have always fought against science and have persecuted its supporters. It leads to methodical action if definite goals are set up in advance.
It leaves open many pos- sibilities. It looks as if the law of motion could be deduced from the field law corresponding to the Newtonian law of force. It looks as if the ruling statesmen of to-day were really trying to secure permanent peace. It looks at first sight as if our estimate of a man depended entirely on his socia!qualities. It looks at first sight as if our estimate of a man depended entirely on his social qualities. It looks to me far more Iike an embodiment of the principle ut aliquid fieri .J,. It looks to me far more like an embodiment of the principle ut aliquid fieri videatur. It may appear that all difficulties connected with the definition of time can be removed when in place of time, we substitute the position of the little hand of my watch.
It may be added that the whole change in the conception of the ether which the special theory of relativity brought about, consisted in taking away from the ether its last mechanical quality, namely, its immobility. It may be added that the whole difference which the special theory of relativity made in our conception of the ether lay in this, that it divested the ether of its last mechanical quality, namely immobility. It may be mentioned here that the equations of Hertz become the same as those of Cohn, if the auxilliary conditions are (53) E = E,M=/.M, J = (rE. It may be mentioned that there is yet another kind of curved space: " elliptical space." It may be noted tbat gv is nothing more than the comple?
It may be shown that this is uniquely settled by means of the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light and the principle of special relativity. It may be simpler, of course, to reach preliminary agreement among the strongest military powers than among all nations, big and small, for a body of representatives of all nations is a hopelessly clumsy instrument for the speedy achievement of even preliminary results. It may be that the United S,tates hopes in this way to frighten the Soviet Union into accepting supranational contro!of atomic energy. It may be that the public is not fully aware that in an? It may eventually emerge as the agency of "security without illusion" that we so badly need.
It may intimidate the human race to bring order into its international affairs, which, without the pressure of fear, it undoubtedly would not do. It may measure the dangers in the terms of the three bombs exploded before the end of the last war. It may move, for instance, in the field of an atomic QUANTA 303 nucleus or it may diffract on a crystal. It may seem as though there is no way out of these difficulties, as though no physical theory can avoid them. It may seem to us today to be but a short step THE MECHANICS OF NEWTON 3I from Galileos discoveries to Newtons law of mo- tion. It means a knowledge of statistical results in which the contributing personalities play no role.
It means nothing to us whether the source of this magnetic field is another circuit through which an electric current flows, or a bar magnet. It means that one can point to the parts of sensible experience to which those words refer. It means that the number of molecules in a given volume, at a certain temperature and pressure, is something which is characteristic, not of a particular gas, but of all gases. It might appear possible to overcome all the difficulties attending the definition of OtimeO by substituting Othe position of the small hand of my watchO for time.
It might appear that there are no essential methodological differences between astronomy and economics: scientists in both fields attempt to discover laws of general acceptability for a circumscribed group of phenomena in order to make the interconnection of these phenomena as clearly understandable as possible. It might be thought that these approximations must lead us to Newton's theory. It might happen one fine day that the sun, the earth and Mars lie absolutely in the same straight line. It might possibly turn out that this extrapolation has no better warrant than the extrapolation of the idea of temperature to parts of a body of molecular order of magnitude.
It might, of course, be objected that a construction composed of solid rods departs more and more from ideal rigidity in proportion as its spatial extent becomes greater. It must be admitted that the new theoretical conception owes its origin not to any Hight of fancy but to the compel? It must be carefully noted that the Fresnelian convection -coefficient implicitly assumes the existence of a fixed ether (Fresnel) or at least a wholly stagnant medium at sufficiently distant regions (Stokes), with reference to which alone a convection velocity can have any significance. It must be clear even to the nonmathematician that, as a consequence of this purely formal addition to our knowledge, the theory perforce gained clearness in no mean measure.
It must be concluded that if the theory of water as a congrega- tion of particles is correct, the size of the particles must be beyond the limit of visibility of the best micro- scopes. It must be proved that a symmetry so defined is a property independent of the system of reference. It must be remembered that a wave is characterized by two numbers, its velocity and its wave-length. It must not be assumed that the moving body carries the surrounding ether along. It must remain to be seen, during the working out of the theory, whether electromagnetics and the doctrine of gravi tation are able in collaboration to perform what the former by itself is unable to do.
It must see to it that competition among the workers is kept within healthy limits, that ali children are given a chance to develop soundly, and that wages are high enough for the goods produced to be consumed. It must see to it that competition among the workers is kept within healthy limits, that all children are given a chance to develop soundly, and that wages are high enough for the goods produced to be consumed. It need hardly be mentioned that this is an idealized experiment which cannot be carried out in reality but may well be imagined. It need not be assumed here that the time taken for this process is zero, but only that this time should be negligible compared with the times which the molecule spends in states Z\, etc.
It not only gave results for the movements of the heavenly bodies, down to the most minute details, but also furnished a theory of the mechanics of discrete and continuous masses, a simple explanation of the principle of the conservation of energy and a complete and brilliant theory of heat. It offers two possibilities: 1) The universe is spatially infinite. It only helps us to understand what we should call the velocity vector and enables us to determine it for a given instant at a given point. It opens out to Jews who are despairing in the Ukrainian hell or in Poland, hope for a more human existence.
It pays far this, however, by renouncing representation of the connection between the notional construction and the sense experience upon which connection, alone, the signilcance of geometry for physics rests. It pervades the citizenry even in countries which do not harbor outspoken ag? It possesses a finite volume, which is determined by its "radius" (2!2R3). It presupposes that information about time and the form of moving objects has meaning independent of the motion of the moving reference frame. It pronounces as follows a-The laws of mechanics apply to the space R1, in respect to which the body 81 is at rest, bu t not to the space R2 , in respect to which the body 82 is at rest.
It proposes certain actions on the part of our people and our government which I think would be helpful in lessening the present tensions. It proved a difficult task; for it has, alas, to be admitted that-at least in tbe countries wtb whichIam most closely acquainted-tbe artists and men of learning permit themselves to be governed by narrow nationalism to a far greater extent tban tbe men of affairs. It really becomes absolutely necessarv to make this differentiation only when one examines the degree to which the whole system of concepts considered is not empty from the physical point of view.
It really becomes absolutely themselves are arbitrary, it is their ri which the whole system of concepts gidity alone which makes the game pos considered is not empty from the physi cal point of view. It reappears as the rotation continues and we regain the initial view when the initial position is reached. It reduces optical problems to electromagnetic problems. It relates to the totality of laws which must hold for the relative positions of rigid bodies independently of time. It removes the difficulties and contradictions of the field theory; it formulates more general mechanical laws; it replaces two conservation laws by one; it changes our classical concept of absolute time.
It requires some power of reflection to see the issue clearly and a certain courage to serve this great cause resolutely and effectively. It resembles a statue of marble which stands in the desert and is continuously tl1reatened with burial by the shifting sand. It resists change of velocity more strongly than the resting body. It revealed neither its mechanical construction nor absolute motion. It runs as follows: The State is made for man, not man for the State. It satisfies the condition x'2 - c2t'2 = x2 - c2t2 . It seemed as though they were completely losing their identity in the superior numbers and more highly organized culture of the nations among whom they lived, so that in a few generations there would be no trace of them left.
It seemed beyond a doubt that light was to be explained as the vibration of an elastic, inert medium filling the whole of space. It seems clear to me that such considerations cannot throw light upon a change in the emotional approach to the generai problems of life. It seems con- tradictory to all previous experience. It seems difficult to understand why the "very celebrated physicists", as Oersted called them, expected such an influence. It seems hardly possible to surmount these difficulties on the basis of the Newtonian theory. It seems natural to conclude that the stronger the action exerted on a body, the greater will be its speed. It seems that the human mind has first to construct forms independently before we can find them in things.
It seems that the new quantum physics resembles somewhat the kinetic theory of matter, since both are of a statistical nature and both refer to great aggrega- tions. It seems to 15 me that complete clearness as to this state of things first became common property through that new departure in mathematics which is known by the name of mathematical logic or Axiomatics. It seems to be clear, therefore, that the Bora statistica!interpretation of the quan? It seems to me that Poincare clearly recognized the truth in the account he gave in his book, "La Science et 1'Hypothese." It seems to me that complete clearness as to this state of things first became common property through that new departure in mathematics which is known by the name of mathematical logic or "Axiomatics."
It seems to me that every reasonable and responsible citizen in the world must know where his choice lies. It seems to me that the most important function of art and of science is to arouse and keep alive this feeling in those who are receptive. It seems to me that the observations associated with blackbody radiation, fluorescence, the production of cathode rays by ultraviolet light, and other related phenomena connected with the emission or transformation of light are more readily understood if one assumes that the energy of light is discontinuously distributed in space. It seems to me that the working out with a view to selection of a particular pian for an international government should not, at the present mo?
It seems to me that what is important is the farce of this superpersonal content and the depth of the conviction concerning its overpowering meaningfulness, regard? It seems to me that what is important is the force of this super-personal content and the depth of the conviction conceming its overpowering meaningfulness regardless of whether any attempt is made to unite this content with a divine Being, for otherwise it would not be possible to count Buddha and Spinoza as religious person? It seems to me, therefore, doubtful whether it can be called a religion in the accepted sense of the word, particularly as no "faith" but the sanctification of life in a supra-personal sense is demanded of the Jew.
It seems to us that this criterion, while far from exhausting all possible ways of recognizing a physical reality, at least provides us with one 778 E I NSTE I N, PODOLSKY AN D ROSE N where a is a number, then the physical quantity A has with certainty the value a whenever the particle is in the state given by P. In accordance with our criterion of reality, for a particle in the state given by P for which Eq. It seems, therefore, that such a degeneration of the co-efficients g,.. is required by the postu? It shatters the concepts of the inertial sys? It should also be noted that the Fresneliau convection coefficient comes out in the theory of relativity as a direct consequence of Einstein's addition of velocities and is quite independent of any electrical theory of matter.
It should be kept in mind, however, that the optical observations refer to time averages rather than instantaneous values. It should be noted that this explanation is essentially based on the fact that the slow circulating movement of the water exerts a considerable influ- ence on the distribution of velocities, because the ad- justment of velocities which counteracts this conse- quence of the circulating movement is also a slow process on account of internal friction. It should be noted that this theoretical scheme is in essence an atomistic and mechanistic one.
It should be observed that it could scarcely be shown that no looieallv consistent ether theorv was possible ; indeed ill 1910, H. A. Wilson offered a consis- sent ether ilieor\ which was at least quite neutral with respect to all available optical data. It should be observed that only the " excess " portion is carried away, while the rest remains as stagnant as ever. It should be observed that the Lorentz transformation is not identical with the Einstein transformation. It should be pointed out that nothing can be gained merely by demanding disannament, so long as there are powerful coun? It should be possible to produce enough of the necessaries of life to satisfy everybody and at the same time give work to everybody.
It should be strongly emphasized that according to our conception the quantity of light emitted under conditions of low illumination (other conditions remaining constant) must be proportional to the strength of the incident light, since each incident energy quantum will cause an elementary process of the postulated kind, independently of the action of other incident energy quanta. It should be understood that television is used only as an example and is not essential to our argument. It should develop in the young individuals those qualities and capabilities which are of value far the welfare of the commonwealth. It should develop in the young individuals those qualities and capabilities which are of value for the welfare of the commonwealth.
It should further be ob- served that the circular motion possesses inertia. It should not be difficult to imagine someone who knows absolutely nothing about electricity, since all the ancients lived happily enough without any knowledge of it. It should not be fargotten that the atomic bomb was made in this country as a preven? It should not be necessary, in establishing a world govern? It should not use the atomic bomb on its own initiative any more than the United States or any other power should do so. It showed me that a sense of responsibility and initiative is at work in the young generation of this country. It shows me that there is good will available on your side too for solving the present difficulties in a manner worthy of both our nations.
It so happens that we are forced to put the negative of the above into the gravitational equa- tions if it is to be possible to obtain static spher- ically symmetric solutions of the equations, free from singularities, which could represent elec- trical particles. It stands to the everlasting credit of science that by acting on the human mind it has overcome man's insecurity before himself and before nature. It still remains to be shown how the wave theory explains the refraction of light and the variety of colours. It strikes me as unfair, and even in bad taste, to select a few of them for bqundless admiration, attributing super? It strikes me as unfair, and even in bad taste, to select a few of them fur boundless admiration, attributing superhuman powers of mind and character to them.
It then appeared that in the frame- work of the program sketched this elementary state of affairs could not at all or at any rate not in any nat- ural fashion, be represented in a sat- isfactory way. It then follows from Poisson's equation that, in order that </> may tend to a 177 . It therefore appears as if this electromotive force had become fused with the electric field intensity into a single entity. It therefore appears unavoidable that physical reality must be described in terms of continuous functions in space. It therefore follows for our case that G;k - tg;1:G = P ,k - hikP (i, k = 1, 2, 3) GH - g44G = -}P. We pursue our reflections, from this point on, in two ways. It therefore follows that I gv I X I gv I = 1 .
It thus appears that, of all Galileian co-ordinate systems, one (K) corresponding to a particular state of motion is physically unique. It thus has meaning to say that the momentum of .the par- ticle in the state given by Eq. It took an unbelievably long time in the history of science for these two to be distinguished, but once this distinction was made rapid progress resulted. It tums out, however, that this contradiction is only an apparent one which is based essentially on the prejudice about the absolute character of time or rather of the simul? It turned out that the angular velocity of this motion went through a regular change in the course of the year.
It turned out that the inertia of a system necessarily depends on its energy-content, and this led straight to the notion that inert mass is simply latent energy. It turns out that also in this case there is no difficulty in forming a solution without singu- larity corresponding to the solution just given. It turns out that the first term of our formula results from assuming that radiation consists of localized groupings of energy h that are reflected and move through space independently of one another an idea presented by the most primitive picture of the light-quanta hypothesis. It turns out that the inertial mass of an object decreases by L / c2 when that object emits radiation of energy L. This can be derived as follows.
It u X 0, then there exists according to 16), in case \ u \ <1, a special Lorentz-trans- formation, whose vector v is equal to this vector n [x, y, Zy t)f and we pass on to a new system of reference {x\ y' z i') in accordance with this transformation. It was Bohr who showed for the first time why just these and no other lines appear in the spectra. It was Ernst Mach, who, in his "History of Mechanics," shook this dogmatic faith; this book exercised a profound influence upon me in this regard while I was a student. It was Huygens, a contemporary of Newton, who put forward quite a new theory. It was Lize Meitner who provided the correct interpretation, and escaped from Germany to place the information in the hands of Niels Bohr. It was Newton who made the inspired guess on this point.
It was Newtons theory of gravitation that first assigned a cause for gravity by interpreting it as action at a distance, proceeding from masses. It was a great achievement of Herzl's to have realized and proclaimed at the top of his voice that, the traditional attitude of the Jews being what it was, the establishment of a national home or, more accurately, a centre in Palestine, was a suitable object on which to concentrate our efforts. It was a manif estation of weakness of character and lack of responsibility on the part of the leaders in the affected countries, and of shortsighted selfish?
It was already known that classical mechanics break down in relation to the ultimate constituents of matter, also that atoms con- sist of positively charged nuclei which are surrounded by a layer of atoms of relatively rather loose texture. It was an illusion which any one can easily understand if, for a moment, he dismisses what he has learned from later philosophy and from natural science; he will not be surprised to find that Plato ascribed a higher reality to "Ideas" than to empirically experienceable things.
It was an illusion which anyone can easily understand if, far a moment, he dismisses what he has leamed from later philosophy and from natural science; he will not be snrprised to find that Plato ascribed a higher reality 20 IDEAS AND OPINIONS to "ideas" than to empirically experienceable things. It was at all times clear that, from the point of view of the idea it conveys to us, every motion must be considered only as a relative motion. It was at first a very pleasing divertisement, to view the vivid and intense colours produced thereby. It was because he recognized this, and especially because he impressed it upon the scientific world that Galileo became the father of modern physics and in fact of the whole of modern natural science.
It was clear that at least in the feld of atomistic phenomena the character of everything that bappens is determined by discrete states and by apparently discontinuous transitions between them, Planck's constant h playing a decisive role. It was clear that the HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION XI ether concept had finally outgrown its usefulness. It was clear, however, from the very beginning that this was'only a provisory completion of the theory in the sense of a phenomenological interpretation. It was difficult enough to do so for ordinary light. It was distinctly in favour of the static picture and found in this representation of motion as something existing in time-space a more convenient and more objective picture of reality.
It was evident that the assumption of some kind of discreteness in the optical meduim had become inevit- able. It was first ob- served by the botanist Brown, and was explained eighty years later, at the beginning of this century. It was first offered by Einstein in 1905. It was for this reason that I felt compelled to resign from the Academy, and your letter only shows me how right I was to do so. It was fortunate for the development of mechanics and hence also for the development of physics in generai, that the lack of definiteness in the concept of objective time remained obscured from the earlier philosophers as regards its empirica! It was gained by the contemplation of an idealized experiment, a body moving forever with no friction nor any other external forces acting.
It was in accordance with this basic idea to treat empty space as a special case of ponderable matter in which the relation between field strength and dis? It was known for a long time that the observed emission of light from a heated black body did not corrospond to the formula which could be deduced from the older classical theories of continuous emission and propagation. It was known that if green or ultraviolet light was allowed to fall on a plate of some alkali metal, the plate lost electrons. It was marvellous that this shackled outward existence did not clip the wings of his soul; his imagination and his sense of humour were irrepressible. It was my good fortune to be linked with Mme.
It was necessary for him to secure the co-operation of successful scientific writers and induce them to say what they had to say in a form as far as possible intelligible to non-specialists. It was necessary for him to secure the cooperation of the successful scientists and induce them to say what they had to say in a form as far as possible intelligible to the non-specialist. It was nevertheless an immense work, especially considering the state of mathematics at the time. It was not merely this, conception that was needed but also a mathematical formalism, which existed in a rudimentary form but needed to acquire a systematic form.
It was not observed that the true element of the space-time specification was the event specified by the four numbers x1, x2, x t3, .The conception of something happening was always that of a four-dimensional continuum; but the recognition of this was obscured by the absolute character of the pre-relativity time. It was not till Newton's theory of gravitation that a cause was assigned to it ; it was then explained as a force acting at a distance, due to mass. It was not till this connection was established that a completely causal conception of motion was achieved.
It was observed in the course of experience that even in the absence of wind the trajectories of cannon balls exhibited considerable, irregular varying lateral deflections from the vertical plane through the initial direction of the shots. It was obtained from the condition that the internal energy distribution of the molecules demanded by quantum theory, should follow purely from an emission and absorption of radiation. It was only by considering what takes place during an infinitely short time (the differential law) that Newton reached a formula which applies to all motion whatsoever. It was only for the purpose of obtaining something easily measurable with apparatus already described that we introduced a battery consisting of several elements.
It was only through the theory of general relativity that refinement of these concepts became necessary, as we shall see later. It was only when they found out about these changes that the real shape of the earths orbit and the manner in which it is described were discovered. It was performed by Oersted about a hundred and twenty years ago. It was previously mentioned that sodium when incandescent emits homo- geneous light, light of one colour or one wave-length. It was previously shown that there are phenomena in which light reveals its wave-like character and others in which light reveals its corpuscular character. It was probably the of the field theory, and to the superseding of the foundations of classical mechanics.
It was realized that something of great importance had happened in physics. It was seeing Prandtl's experi- ments that put the idea into Flettners head that this device might be used to take the place of sails. It was simple to change classical mechanics in such a way that it contradicted neither the relativity theory nor the wealth of material obtained by observation and explained by classical mechanics. It was soon realized that Maxwell's theory could not accomplish such a program. It was soon recognized that these kinds of energy, mechanical and heat, are only two of its many forms. It was the experience of mystery even if mixed with fear that engendered religion. It was the experience of mystery-even if mixed with fear-that engendered religion.
It was the general Theory of Relativity which showed in a convincing manner the incorrectness of this view. It was the great merit of H. A. Lorentz that he brought about a change here in a convincing fashion. It was the scientists who first made true democracy possible, for not only did they lighten our daily tasks but they made the finest works of art and thought, whose enjoyment until recently was the privilege of the favored classes, accessible to all. It was the students and the teachers at the universities who kept these ideals alive. It was then only natural that Wien's argument, which had led to eq. It was therefore assumed that motions of this medium would influence optical and electromagnetic phenomena.
It was this basis alone that enabled our civilization to take its rise in Greece and to celebrate its rebirth in Italy at the Renaissance. It was thought of as an "agent" of the current, through which all action of the current was performed. It was thought of as an interruption of man's normai life from the outside, universally considered unfortunate and evil. It was thus legitimate to suppose that the earth's orbit was a self-enclosed one, described by the earth in the same way every year which was by no means obvious a priori. It was thus that the fateful conception-fateful, that is to say, for an. It was, further, a fundamental weak- ness that the forces of reciprocal action, by which events are determined, had to be assumed hypo- thetically in a perfectly arbitrary way.
It was, however, the very same physical mode of thought and its practical successes which have shaken the confidence in the possibility of understanding things and their relations by means of purely speculative thought. It was, however, the very same physical mode of thought and its practical successes which have shaken the conidence in the possibility of understanding things and their relations by means of purely speculative thought. It was, indeed, a long time before the full content of Maxwell's theory was recognized.
It will also be impossible to avoid educating the youth in warlike traditions and cultivating narrow national vanity joined to the glorification of the warlike spirit, as long as people have to be prepared for occasions when such a spirit will be needed in the citizens for the purpose of war. It will also be obvious that the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo must be modifed, since we easily * Eotv s has proved experimeutally that the gro.vito.tional field has this property in great accuracy. It will be assumed for the sake of simplicity that the force is exerted everywhere in the direction of the x axis. It will be better to become more familiar with the meaning of this new assumption and with the conclusions which can be drawn from it.
It will be helpful in understanding later arguments to grasp this idea thoroughly. It will be propagated according to the equation or, if we square this equation, according to the equation x2 + y2 + z2 = c2t2 = 0 . It will be remembered that this force did not act in the line con- necting the wire and the magnetic pole, and depended on the velocity of the moving charge. It will be seen from these reflexions that in pursuing the general theory of relativity we shall be led to a theory of gravitaton, since we a.re able to "produce " a gravitational field merely by changing the system of co-ordinates. It will be shown in 5 that field equation (13a) is compatible with our conjectures on field and matter. It will be shown in the next para?
It will be shown in the next paragraph that the molecular-kinetic theory of heat actually leads to this wider con- ception of osmotic pressure. It will be shown later that this difficulty, together with another even more serious, caused a complete breakdown of the belief that all phenomena can be explained mechanically. It will be shown that in the solution, the invariant ds, given in equation (3) plays a fundamental role, which we, following Gauss's Theory of Surfaces, style as the line-element.
It will be shown that the equations arising in a purely mathematical way out of the conditions of the general relativity, together with equations (46), give us the New- tonian law of attraction as a first approximation, and lead in the second approximation to the explanation of the perihelion-motion of mercury discovered by Leverrier (the residual effect which could not be accounted for by the consideration of all sorts of disturbing factors). It will be simple to generalize all that we have just said for the case of motion not restricted to a straight line. It will be smaller in the direction of the motion relative to the ether-sea as the wall runs away, and greater in the opposite direction as the wall moves toward the wave and tries to meet it sooner.
It will be the aim of the following lines to demonstrate what paths the constructive human mind has entered, in arder to arrive at a basis of physics which is logically as uni? It will be urged against this notion, not without a certain justification, that it over-estimates the efficacy of machinery, and neglects the psychological, or rather the moral, factor. It will become apparent that we shall only then arrive at a theory which is free from contradictions, if we consider such elementary processes to be perfectly directional; this embodies the main result of the subsequent discussion.
It will give what help it can in the immediate crisis and reawaken that higher community of feeling, now thrust into the background by national egotism, for which human values have a validity independent of politics and frontiers. It will have validity only for a spe cial field of application (i.e., there are no final categories in the sense of Kant). It will now be clear what is meant if I make the following ::-:.
It will now be clear what is meant if I make the following statement: By his clear critique Hume did not only advance philosophy in a decisive way but also-though through no fault of his-created a danger for philosophy in that, following his critique, a fateful "fear of metaphysics" arose which has come to be a malady of contemporary empiricistic philosophizing; this malady is the counterpart to that earlier philosophizing in the clouds, which thought it could neglect and dispense with what was given by the senses. It will soon become apparent, how- ever, that this again is a false clue, that heat cannot be regarded as a substance, even weightless. It will then be an easy matter to revert to the generall y covariant equations, if this seems desirable in a special case.
It will then procure for every nation conditions of work under which it can exist and under which it can bring forth fruits of culture. It will therefore be sufficient to deduce the ex? It would also mean that a solenoid and a bar attract or repel each other in the same way as two bars. It would at least be a novelty in this dreary sphere of infinite confusion, and besides why should not such heroic feelings on the part of the fair sex find a more picturesque outlet than in attacks on a defenceless civilian? It would be better to say that space is infinite in relation to practically-rigid bodies, assuming that the laws of disposition for these bodies are given by Euclidean geometry.
It would be far the three individuals who draft the constitution to devise ways for their di:fferent structures to be :fitted together for collaboration. It would be foolish to despise tradition. It would be just as ridiculous to apply the theory of relativity to the motion of cars, ships, and trains as to use a calculating machine where a multiplication table would be sufficient. It would be much more difficult to form a picture of ether carrying transverse waves. It would be quite difficult to prove its usefulness in the case of gravitation. It would be rather difficult to describe this force in words. It would be rather difficult to see any strong similarity between the current flowing through a solenoid and a bar magnet if this were not revealed by our construction of the field.
It would be risky to answer these questions by a simple "yes" or "no" without going more deeply into their meaning. It would be soon shown that the general rela- tivity theory can not hold fast to this simple physical significance of space and time. It would be very difficult to repeat them, after reading the account only once, without becoming confused. It would be very helpful far the purpose of psychological investigation to know what internal or menta! It would be very imsatisfactoiy^ if the new way o looking at the time-concept, which permits a Lorentz transformation, were to be confined to a single part of Physics. It would be wise if this constitution were to be negotiated by a single American, a single Briton and a single Russian.
It would even be possible to estimate its spatial magnitude. It would frighten him to think that the great adventure ofresearch could be so soon finished, and an unexciting if infallible picture of the universe established for all time. It would give countenance to many whose good intentions are paralysed to-day by a melancholy resignation. It would have been an easy matter for the Academy to get hold of a correct version of my words before issuing the sort of statement about me that it has. It would however be erroneous to think that this step signifies a partial renunciation of the general relativity postulate. It would mean that if a solenoid and a bar magnet have the same field, then all their influences must also be the same.
It would mean that two solenoids, carrying electric currents, behave like two bar magnets, that they attract or repel each other, depending exactly as in the case of bars, on their relative positions. It would not be di:fficult to come to an agreement as to what we understand by science. It would not be difficult to come to an agreement as to what we understand by science. It would not be difficult to trace the interference of the two waves and discover the one wave resulting from their superposition; it is called the standing wave. It would seem sufficient in the present case, for example, to broaden the previous point of view and introduce more general forces between the elemen- tary particles.
It would seem that OA and OB could not really have been of the same length ; and if OB was of length I, OA must have been of length IjP. It would seem wise to avoid the ambiguity resulting from the existence of two distinct theories of the same phenomena, by deciding in favour of one of them after a careful consideration of the faults and merits of each. It would surely be absurd to judge the value of the Talmud, for instance, by its intellectual fruits. It would then be impossible to show that the shadows increase in size as they move away from S; such an assertion would then no longer have any meaning whatever. It would thus appear as though we were moving here in a logical circle."
It would, of course, be a great step forward if we succeeded in combining the gravitational field and the electro-magnetic field into a single structure. It yields more or less easily, according to its inertial mass, resisting the motion more strongly if the mass is large than if it is small. It, nonethe- less, one would find sufficient reasons for it, there would then arise an im- mense number of field-laws out of quantities g.^^ all of which are covar- iant under Lorentz-transformations (not, however, under the general group). Itbecame practical through the accidental discovery of chain reaction, and this was not something I could have predicted.

Itis "society" which provides man with food, clothing, a home, the tools of work, language, the forms of thought, and most of the content of thought; his life is made possible through the labor and the accomplishments of the many millions past and present who are all hidden behind the small word "society." Itis a task never finished, something always present to guide our judgment and to inspire our conduct. Itis an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this. Itis an outcome of faith that nature -as she is perceptible to our five senses-takes the character of such a well formulated puzzle. Itis assumed that with such an interpretation the Euclidean laws are valid.
Itis formed by equating to zero the once contracted Rieman- nian curvature tensor ( RO). Itis maintained that perhaps the success of the Heisenberg method points to a purely algebraical method of description of nature, that is to the elimination of continuous functions from physics. Itis not enough to teach man a specialty. Itis now easy to understand the dilemma which has led to the special theory of relativity. Itis this cultura!constitution which, with the passage of time, is subject to change and which determines to a very large extent the relationship between the individuai and society. Itmay be remarked here that the inertial system is a weak point of the Galilean-New? Itmight appear that there are no essen?
Itmust be admitted that Huygbens' theory also was based in the first instance upon classica! Itmust be mentioned that the result of this theory ';ontains - as limiting values-the result of the particle mechanics if the wave-length encountered during the solution of the Schrodinger problem is everywhere so small that the potential energy varies by a practically in.6.nitely small amount for a change of one wave-length in the configuration-space. Its affirmations rest essentially on induction from experience, but not on logical inferences only. Its anthropomorphic character is shown, far instance, by the fact that men appeal to the Divine Being in prayers and plead far the fulfillment of their wishes.
Its application leads to simple and convincing explanations of many facts pre- viously incoherent and misunderstood. Its change of velocity is, for the observer in each c.s., a difference between two velocities, and the contribution due to the uniform relative motion of the two c.s. Its components satisfy, by (38), the condition u?2 = ?1 (40) We see that this 4-vector, whose components in the ordinary notation are 1q?xq2 , 1q?yq2 , 1q?zq2 , 1?i q2 (41) is the only 4-vector which can be formed from the velocity components of the material particle which are defined in three dimensions by qx = dxdl , qy = dydl , qz = dzdl We therefore see that ? Its equation is (20) u p. ^ S LP.
Its equaton is P' o ds = O p (20) Carrying out the variation in the usual way, we obtain from this equation four differential equations which define the geodetic line ; this operation will be inserted here for the sake of completeness. Its formai simplicity is characterized by the properties of homogeneity and isotropy ( and the existence of similar entities ). Its fulfilment brings formal complications and forces us to use mathematical tools different from those so far employed in physics. Its infiuence on tbe shaping of international relations is absolutely incalculable. Its influence on the shaping of international relations is absolutely incalculable. Its length represents the magnitude of the velocity, or the speed as indicated, for instance, by the speedometer of a car.
Its presence cannot be detected by the naked eye; a photo- graphic plate must be used. Its quantity may change or not, like money put aside in a safe or spent. Its realm is accordingly de.fined as that part of the sum total of our knowledge which is capable of being ex? Its starting-point is the end of the first vector and its end- point the end of the second vector. Its story, by no means finished, is continued by the relativity theory. Its use is no longer limited to the communication of purely Jewish matters to Jews; it is beginning to embrace all fields of human interest. Its validity can be confirmed by experiment: in a room where the only source of light is incandescent sodium everything is either yellow or black.
Its validity is not restricted to one domain of physics; it forms a general framework embracing all phenomena of nature. Itwas discovered by Hahn in Berlin, and he himself misinterpreted what he discovered. Itwas the approach that was disputed. Itwas therefore merged with the energy principle -just as, about 60 years befare, the principle of the conser? J # and (32) "S rfa =(7 (( n dg "^ 6(7 a tt/^ The expression (31) allows a transfonnation which we shall often use; according to (21) (33) 8? J , where J is independent of axl, dy,, etc., as well as of V*, i.e. J I From this equation, we can in a wellknown way deduce 4 total differential equations which define the geodetic line ; this deduction is given here for the sake of completeness.
J r Therefore the eloek o^oes slowly what it is placed in the neighbourhood of ponderable masses. J the extension of a four- vector. JFe can change the system of reference in any possifjle manner corresjjonding to the above- mentioned group transformation Gc, but the expressions for natttral laws ivill not be changed thereby. Jacques Hadamard, a French mathematician, conducted a psychological survey of mathematicians to determine their mental processes at work. Jeffery from the German Das Relativatsprinzip, 4th ed., published by in 1922 by Tuebner. Jewish Recovery I gladly accede to your paper's request that I should address an appeal to the Jews of Hungary on behalf of Keren Hajessod.
Jewish Youth An Answer to a Questionnaire It is important that the young should be induced to take an interest in Jewish questions and difficulties, and you deserve gratitude for devoting yourself to this task in your paper. Jewish hands are reclaiming more and more neglected and waste lands and transforming them into fertile fields and orchards. Jewish nationalism is a necessity be cause only through a consolidation of our national life can we eliminate those conflicts from which the Jews suffer to-day. Joule measured this change of temperature and, making use of the known specific heat of water, calculated the amount of heat absorbed. Joule verified by experiment the guess that heat is a form of energy, and determined the rate of exchange.
Joy in looking and comprehending is nature's most beauti? Judaism is not a creed: the Jewish God is simply a negation of superstition, an imaginary result of its elimination. Judaism is thus no transcendental religion; it is concerned with life as we live it and can up to a point grasp it, and nothing else. Judaism seems to me to be concerned almost exclusively with the moral attitude in life and to life. Just as he is about to proclaim the principle of inertia, someone suddenly plays a practical joke on him. Just as he was in command of physics and of the mathematical 76 IDEAS AND OPINIONS formalism, thus he also was in co=and of himself without effort and strain.
Just as it was consistent from the Newtonian standpoint to make both the statements, tempus est absolutum, spatium est absolutum, so from the standpoint of the special theory of relativity we must say, continuum spatii et temporis est absolutum. Just as it was there impossible to construct a Cartesian coordinate system from equal rods, so here it is impossible to build up a system (referencebody) from rigid bodies and clocks, which shall be of such a nature that measuring-rods and clocks, arranged rigidly with respect to one another, shaIll indicate position and time directly. Just as light does not cause electromagnetic oscillations ; it is the oscillations." Just as ob- viously, a push in the direction opposite to that of the motion would decrease the speed.
Just how great is this change? Just over a hundred years ago, Faraday performed an experiment which led to the great discovery of in- duced currents. Just the changes of an electromagnetic field ! Just when the flashes (as judged from the embankment) of lightning occur, this point M1 naturally coincides with the point M but it moves towards the right in the diagram with the velocity v of the train. K I pdr whereas the Newtonian theory for the chosen unit of time gives K 1 pdr where K denotes usually the gravitation-constant. K is a covariant four-vector whose components are eqnal to tlie nes^ative impulse and energy which are transferred to th<^ electro-magnetic Held per unit ol time, and per unit of volume, by the electrical masses.
K is then a Galileian referencebody as regards the domain considered, and the results of the special theory of relativity hold relative to K. Let us supposse the same domain referred to a second body of reference K1, which is rotating uniformly with respect to K. In order to fix our ideas, we shall imagine K1 to be in the form of a plane circular disc, which rotates uniformly in its own plane about its centre. K0 From this equation it directly follows that:N If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c2. Ke cannot, however, calculate the state in which either one of the two systems is left after the interaction. Ke see now in the given solution, free from singularities, the mathematical representation of an elementary particle (neutron or neutrino).
Kepler also discovered the law governing the variation in speed during rotation, which is that the line sun- planet sweeps out equal areas in equal periods of time. Kepler found a marvelous way out of this dilemma. Kepler had to discover a way of bringing order into this chaos. Kepler lived in an age in which the reign of law in nature was by no means an accepted certainty.
Kepler's empirical laws of planetary movement, de- duced from Tycho Brahes observations, confronted him, and demanded explanation.^ These laws gave, it is true, a complete answer to the question of how the planets move around the sun (the elliptical shape of the orbit, the sweeping of equal areas by the radii in equal times, the relation between the major axes and the period of circulation around the sun) ; but they did not satisfy the demand for causal explanation. Keplers marvelous achievement is a par- ticularly fine example of the truth that knowledge cannot spring from experience alone but only from the comparison of the inventions of the intellect with observed fact. Kinetic energy and field-energy appear as essentially different things.
Knowing how the particle moves, we should like to picture its motion once more. Knowing the form of the oscillating cord at a given instant, we know everything we wish. Knowing the initial velocity and its change, we can find the velocity and position of the planet at the end of the time interval. Knowing what the field ex- presses, we shall examine with a far deeper interest the lines of force corresponding to the current. Knowledge exists in two forms-lfeless, stored in books, and alive in the conscousness of men. Knowledge is dead; the school, however, serves the living.

LAf>IES AND GENTLEMEN: You are assembled today to devote your attention to the problem of human rights. LIGHT AS SUBSTANCE Again we start with a few experimental facts. LIGHT SPECTRA We already know that all matter is built of only a few kinds of particles. LL of the previous considerations have been based upon the assumption that all inertial systems A are equivalent for the description of physical phenomena, but that they are preferred, for the formulation of the laws of nature, to spaces of reference in a different state of motion. LONGITUDINAL OR TRANSVERSE LIGHT WAVES? Labor is expensive, because the country is sparsely inhabited in comparison with its natural resources. Labour is expensive, because the country is sparsely inhabited in comparison with its natural resources.
Last year I asked a well-known American diplomat why Japan was not forced by a commercial boycott to desist from her policy of force. Latent heat is temporarily hidden, like money put away in a safe, but available for use if one knows the lock combination. Later developments both destroyed old concepts and created new ones. Later on electrical corpuscles were added to these, making a third kind, again with completely different characteristics. Later on, bowever, as the pbenomena of polarization, diffraction and interference of ligbt forced upon bis theory core and more unnatural modifcations, Huygbens' undula? Later on, he migrated to the German Universitv of Prague in Bohemia as ausser-ordentliche (or associate) Professor.
Later we shall have occasion to follow the history of the family, its rise and fall. Later writers have sometimes used the sj^mbol n to denote this operation. Laws concerning variables connected more directly with experimental facts (for example: temperature, pressure, speed ) were deduced from the fundamental ideas by means of complicated calculations. Laws of nature relating subsequent events were un- known to the Greeks.

Lefc us multiply (26) with the con ti'avariant fnndaniental tensor ^'^^^(inner multiplication), then by a transformation of the first member, the right-hand side takes the form 9(/^ 1 Tu / ^'^a According to (31) and (29).

Let this be the case in a certain finite space in relation to a definite system of co-ordinates K0 Relatively to this system all the components of the Riemann tensor B P , defined in (43), vanish. Let this body send out, in a direction making an angle ? Let this lantern M be further away from the sun than the earth. Let this man be given metal, gold foil, bottles, hard-rubber rod, flannel, in short, all the material required for performing our three experiments.
Let this parallel relation further fulfil the condition of angular uniformity : If PG and PK are two directions in P, P'G' and P'K' the corresponding parallel directions through P', then the angles KPG and K'P'G' (measurable on Euclidean lines in the local system) should be equal. Let this piece of the ^-axis be covered with a rod moving with the velocity v relative to the system K and perpendicular to its axis ;the ends of the rod having therefore the co-ordinates I Therefore the length of the rod measured in the system K is ~r7~Y For the system moving with velocity (v), we have on grounds of symmetry, I I cfi{v) <f>{v) l4 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY / 4. Let us accept the defeat of the corpuscular theory of light until we recognize the problematic nature of the victory of the wave theory.
Let us add to this characteristic transformation any possible displacement of the space and time null-points ; then we get a group of transformation depending only on c, which we may denote by Gc. Let us again consider a stone dropped from a tower. Let us again imagine an idealized experiment. Let us again take a very simple example. Let us assume a body, having a definite mass, moving along a straight line, and acted upon by an external force in the direction of the motion. Let us assume that all lighted bodies emit particles of light, or corpuscles, which, falling on our eyes, create the sensation of light. Let us assume that in our "slow motion" the light travels one mile in a second.
Let us assume that the molecule is capable of a transition from state Zn into state Zm with an absorption of radiation energy smen', that, similarly, the transition from state Zm to state Zn is possible, with emission of the same radiative energy. Let us assume that the wire is bent to form a circle, in the centre of which a magnetic gi needle is placed, both wire and needle lying in the same plane. Let us assume that these spheres are connected by means of an insulator such as a glass rod. Let us assume that this is never the case. Let us assume that we have a rigid circular cylinder moving in the direction of its axis. Let us assume the ivr to be the periodic solutions (put in the arder of increasing energy values ) of the Schrodinger equation.
Let us assume, for the sake of simplicity, that we have only one clock in the upper c.s. Let us at this moment remember with gratitude our leader Weizmann, whose zeal and circumspection have helped the good cause to success. Let us begin our examination at the moment the sphere begins to expand. Let us begin with a simple example. Let us briefly examine the progression of this change. Let us cali such a connection between the two (identica!) Let us call any world-point O as a " Spaee-time-null- point.'' Let us call such an object "practically rigid." Let us call this force the "radiation friction". Let us call to mind what the general theory of relativity teaches in this respect. Let us change the apparatus slightly for a third experiment.
Let us conceive of the world-line of such an electron with the charge [e), and let us introduce upon it the '^ Propjr-time " r reckoned from any possible initial point. Let us conceive that a material point F of mass m may, owing to the presence of another material point F"^, experience a moving force according to the following law.
Let us consider a rigid sphere {i.e.y one having a spherical figure when tested in the stationary system) of radius R which is at rest relative to the system (K), and whose centre coincides with the origin of ^ then the equa- tion of the surface of this sphere, which is moving with a velocity v relative to K, is ; At time t= Oj the equation is expressed by means of (ar, y, Zy t,) as '13 ( Vi-^J A rigid body which has the figure of a sphere when measured in the moving system, has therefore in the moving conditionwhen considered from the stationary system, the figure of a rotational ellipsoid with semi-axes K V 1 ^, R, R. Therefore the y and z dimensions of the sphere (there- fore of any figure also) do not appear to be modified by the motion, but the a^ dimension is shortened in the ratio 1 : \'^ 1 ; the shortening is the larger, the larger c is V. oY v = c, all moving bodies, when considered from a stationary system shrink into planes.
Let us consider a space time domain in which no gravitational field exists relative to a referencebody K whose state of motion has been suitably chosen. Let us consider a spatially bounded, closed system, which, four-dimensionally, we may represent as a strip, outside of which the T? Let us consider another experiment based upon a very simple idea. Let us consider another idealized experiment, in which a perfect sphere rolls uniformly on a smooth table. Let us consider how these difficulties arise. Let us consider now a second two-dimensional existence, but this time on a spherical surface instead of on a plane. Let us consider the case of one electron. Let us consider the case of two c.s. Let us consider the essentials of this process.
Let us consider the motion of a ])article according to the equation (46). Let us consider the problem more abstractly, without ship or train. Let us consider the sheet, in the region of ^>o, and let us now conceive the transformation of ,>, y, z, i in the new system of variables ; (.</, y', z ^ t') by means of which the form of the expression will remain unaltered. Let us consider the simplest example: two particles with forces acting between them. Let us consider this for a moment. Let us consider two neighbouring events, the relative position of which in the four-dimensional continuum is given with respect to a Galileian reference-body K by the space co-ordinate differences dx, dy, dz and the time-difference dt.
Let us consider two spheres moving in different di- rections on a smooth table. Let us consider, for instance, a material point with any kind of motion. Let us continually repeat the same elementary processes. Let us decompose a vector drawn from O towards {a',]/,z,t) into its components. Let us determine P, Q, r as before, construct the middle-point M of the hyperbola of curvature at P, and finally the normal MN upon a line through P which is parallel to QPj. Let us devote a little while to the consideration of these two subjects. Let us discuss in more detail the two different ways of determining mass. Let us discuss this motion from the stand-jmint of any arbitrary co-ordinate-system K;; it moves with reference to Kj (as explained in ^'l) in a gravitational field.
Let us draw the cross section of the upper sheets with the plane of the .r- and /-axes, i.e., the upper half of the hyperbola <?-/2_,2_. Let us examine the fundamental facts of motion more closely, starting with simple everyday experiences familiar to mankind since the beginning of civilization and gained in the hard struggle for existence. Let us express the fact that the point with the current co-ordinates x? Let us first consider the question from the point of view of scientific knowledge. Let us first discuss the case of absorption of radiation. Let us first establish a scale. Let us follow the motion of the idealized car on the idealized switchback as it begins to roll downward from the starting-point.
Let us for a moment consider from this point of view any axiom of geometry, for instance, the following: Through two points in space there always passes one and only one straight line. Let us for a moment consider from this point of view any axiom of geometry, for instance, the following:Through two points in space there always passes one and only one straight line. Let us form the determinant, g, of the g?, and also the cofactors, divided by g, corresponding to the various g?.
Let us form the reduction of (89) with reference to the indices a and <r, we obtain remembering (29a) Tf we introduce into the last term the contravariant tensor A" =17" A , it takes the fori'm [or ^ If further A'^ is symmetrical it is reduced to CIENEllALISED THEORY OF KEf-ATIVlTY 13i If instead of A' , we iiitrocliice in a similar way the symmetrical co-variant tensor A =.g g r* A ^ , then owing to (31) the last member can take the form In the symmetrical case treated, ("11) can be replaced by either of the forms T 6 ( v^-y A-^ ) or (Ua) s^-g A = ^ /A a ( v^-^ A^ ) (41b) ^/-^ A = -^^ .- ^ (T .P^ + 1 1^ sf-g A which we shall have to make use of afterwards. Let us further assume that the sources emitting the light signals are perma- nently resting in the room.
Let us further investigate the path of light-rays in a statical gravitational field. Let us have a eo-ordinate system, in wliieh the New- tonian equations hold. Let us have a point-mass of electricity which is of magnitude unity in the stationary system K, i.e.f it exerts a unit force upon a similar quantity placed at a distance of 1 em. Let us have a rigid rod at rest; this has a length /, when measured by a measuring rod at rest ; we suppose that the axis of the rod is laid along the X-axis of the system at rest, and then a uniform velocity /', parallel to the axis of X, is imparted to it.
Let us hope that a historian delivering judgment in some future period when Europe is politically and economically united, will be able to say that in our days the liberty and honour of this Continent was saved by its Western nations, which stood fast in hard times against the temptations of hatred and oppression; and that Western Europe defended successfully the liberty of the indi? Let us hope that the abolition of the existing international anarchy will not need to be bought by a self? Let us ignore both the solenoid and the bar and observe only the two outside fields. Let us imagine a point S of our space, and a great number of small spheres, L', which can all be brought to coincide with one another.
Let us imagine a raven flying through the air in such a manner that its motion, as observed from the embankment, is uniform and in a straight line. Let us imagine that suddenly a very strange thing happens: our sun begins to emit only homogeneous light of some definite colour, say yellow. Let us imagine that the circuit in our last drawing becomes smaller and smaller, shrinking gradually to a very small circuit enclosing a certain point in space. Let us imagine that the hole in the screen is made smaller and smaller. Let us imagine the matter to be of infinitely small extent in space, that is, a four-dimensional thread; then by integration over the whole thread with respect to the space co-ordinates x1, x2, x3, we obtain o K dx dx dx1 1 2 3 = ?
Let us imagine transferring all n movable points into a volume v (part of the volume v0) without anything else being changed in the system. Let us in stationary space take two systems of co-ordinates, i.e. Let us inquire about the velocity of propagation of the ray of light relative to the carriage. Let us just cast our eyes over the history of the Jews in Germany during the past hundred years. Let us leave quantum physics for the moment. Let us leave the question for the moment, since it cannot be settled now. Let us nevertheless stick to the theory and as- sume that it represents a consistent picture of reality. Let us no\v see how far the f'liiidameutal equations assumed by Loreutz correspond to the Relativity postulate, as defined in 8.
Let us not even shun the fight when it is unavoidable to preserve right and the dignity of man. Let us not farget that this enterprise is admirably suited to establish relations between individuals of different nationalities, relations which help to strengthen the idea of a European com? Let us not forget how humanity came into possession of this wonderful means of communication. Let us not forget that this enterprise is admirably calculated to establish such relations between members of different nations as are favourable to the growth of a common European feeling. Let us now adhere to these simpler laws, whereby we require that for the limitting case e=i, ix=1,(t= o, they should constitute the laws for ponderable bodies.
Let us now ask how the space-time tilament of F behaves when the material point F"^ has a uniform trauslatory motion, /. Let us now ask ourselves about the light-pressure exerted on the reflecting surface and the direction, frequency, intensity of the light after reflexion. Let us now cast an eye over the development of the theoretical system, paying special attention to the relations between the content of the theory and the totality of empirical fact.
Let us now conceive of an infinitely thin space- time filament at the point (^* f/ z f) with the n'^rmal section of contents r^J, and if f/J+8r(?J be the contents of the normal section at the corresponding position of the varied filament, then according to the principle of conservation of mass (v + ^/v being the rest-mass-density at the varied position), (8) {v-\-hv) {(U -\-hcUn) vdi nfl^it" In consequence of this condition, the integral (7) taken over the whole range of the sichel, varies on account of the displacement as a definite function N + 8N of X, and we may call this function N + 8N as the mass action of the virtual displacement. Let us now conceive of the first three component of this vector as the ('?
Let us now consider a seconds-clock which is permanently situated at the origin (x1=0) of K1. Let us now consider that a clock which is lying at rest in the stationary sj'stem gives the time t^ and lying at rest relative to the moving system is capable of giving the time t ; suppose it to be placed at the origin of the moving system k, and to be so arranged that it gives the time r. How much does the clock gain, when viewed from the stationary system K ? Let us now consider the quantity of energy, which this surface encloses, when regarded from the system ^, i.e., the energy of the light-complex relative to the system A;.
Let us now consider the space-time vector of the second kind , with the components _ ^,^^-^^^l\, <^2*4-^4^'2: ^3*4-^4^3 -J Then the corresponding space-time vector of the first kind wT*^, ^'] vanishes identically owiug to equations 9) and 53) for co = -(wvp)<^+ (w^)^ Let us now take the vector of the 1st kind with the components i2j_ = L w. etc. Let us now consider the times in which we live. Let us now consider what sort of influence the circular mo- tion due to a bend in the river or the Coriolis-force, as illustrated in fig. Let us now determine the kinetic energy of the electron. Let us now determine the physical condition of the partial system A as completely as possible by measurements.
Let us now discuss this possibility without deciding, for the moment, whether or not clocks really change their rhythm in motion. Let us now enquire ^ about the length of the moving rod ; this can be obtained by either of these operations. Let us now examine what general results the latter theory has hitherto evinced. Let us now fix our attention on a certain point (a*, y, z) of matter at a certain time (/). Let us now fix our attention upon the world-line of a substantive point running through the world-point (t, y, z, t) ; then as we follow the -progress of the line, the quantity c corresponds to the time-like vector-element {clc, dy, dz, dt).
Let us now follow a definite position*.of matter in its course thi'ough all time t. The totality of the space-time points (', y, :, f) which correspond to the positions at different times t, shall be called a space-time line. Let us now form the time-space vector 1st kind^ <if=^ici)f*, whose components are ^^ = i( wj3^,+ 0)3/^2+^^23) 1 Vt'^zz:-/ (coJ^3-f W3/1.4+W4/31) ' "^'3 = ^ (^1/2 4 + ^^2/4 1 + ^^4/1 2 ) I I ^4,I=i ((0j32+W2/i3-f (03/21 ) J Of these, the first three ^1, ^'2, ^3, are the x, y. z components of the space-vector 51) -^^/ vr u and lurtlier (0-) i^_^ r- ^\u'^' * Vide note 16. Let us now go one step farther. Let us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal length have been made, their lengths being small compared with the dimensions of the marble slab.
Let us now imagine that our room moves uniformly through space. Let us now imagine that the uniformly moving cart is given a push in the direction of the motion. Let us now investigate the laws according to which the electron will move in the ^particle of time ^ immediately following this epoch. Let us now move the charge faster. Let us now picture to our mind the world-line passing through any world point ''if/,z,tj now if we find the world-line parallel to the radius vector OA' of the hyperboloidal sheet, then we can introduce OA' as a new time-axis, and then according to the new conceptions of time and space the substance will appear to be at rest in the world point concerned.
Let us now put ( ^^ ") = ^u (^=1, 2, 3, 4) (13) A=o then on the basis of (10) and (11), we have the expression (12) :- Ms: /9f J. Let us now take Ox', OA' as new axes with the unit mea- suring rods 0C' = 1, 0A'= ; then the h^^perbola is again expressed in the form c^t'- '^ = ], t'>o and the transi- tion from ( r, ;f/j ;, t) to ( 'y'^'t^ is one of the transitions in question. Let us now think of measuring the circum- ference and the diameter of these circles, with a unit measuring rod (infinitely small compared with the raidius) and take the quotient of both the results of measurement.
Let us now transform these auxilliary equations \') into the original co-ordinates ( ', f/,z, and t.) According to formula 15) in 4, the component of e' in the direction of the vector u is the same us that of ((5-f ), the component of m is the same as that of vi y but for the perpendicular direction , the com- ponents of e\ m are the same as those of (<? Let us now tum to the intellectual effects that proceed from science. Let us now turn our attention to the part of the ^-axis between (^^o,y]= o,t,= o), and (^=0, ry = l, ^=o). Let us now write down the facts which have been sufficiently confirmed by experiment without bothering any more about the "ether" problem.
Let us now write x\=-/j ^o 2=^^' , x ^=z'y x\^=it' (3) then the substitution 1) takes the form ^ =.r, y =y,z ^ , t = , (4) the coefficients being essentially real. Let us now, for the sake of simplicity, neglect (j/, z) and fix our attention on a two dimensional world, in which let upright strips parallel to the ^^-axis represent a state of rest and another parallel strip inclined to the /.-axis represent a state of uniform motion for a body, which has a constant spatial extension (see fig. Let us picture to ourselves the space-time filaments of F and F"^ along with the principal lines of the filaments. Let us proceed to disclose these sins. Let us proceed to give this question a little consideration. Let us rather examine the objective factors involved.
Let us recall how we described motion when discussing mechanics at the beginning of our journey through the realm of physical problems. Let us remark that in the vectorial method o writing, this can be constructed out of the four vectors. Let us return to our falling handkerchief and watch; for the outside observer they are both falling with the same acceleration. Let us return to the electric sphere which was, until now, at rest, and assume that it begins to move owing to the action of some external force. Let us return to the particle dropped from a 256-foot tower. Let us shortly consider these two things. Let us start from the equations : u PUx + 6x\ _aN 8M 6^ 7 dy dz 1/ _l9^\ a^i_aL 6 .
Let us suppose our old friend the railway carriage to be travelling along the rails with a constant velocity v, and that a man traverses the length of the carriage in the direction of travel with a velocity w. How quickly or, in other words, with what velocity W does the man advance relative to the embankment during the process ? Let us suppose that a point-shaped particle, having the electrical charge e (to be called henceforth the electron) moves in the electromagnetic field ; we assume the following about its law of motion.
Let us suppose that the two clocks synchronous with the clocks in the system at rest are brought to the ends A, and B of a rod, i.e., the time of the clocks correspond to the time of the stationary system at the points where they happen to arrive ; these clocks are therefore synchronous in the stationary system. Let us suppose that the two systems are two particles, and that where %(x(, xg) = P(x,)u, (x))dP, 4 (x ) s(sw(l h) (zgzo) P (12) This Phowever is the eigenfunction of the operator P= (8/2')(7/Bx2, (13) corresponding to the eigenvalue p of the momentum of the second particle. Let us suppose that the world-line of a second point- electron passes through the world-point Pj.
Let us suppose that we place similar clocks at points of the system K, at rest relatively to it, and regulated according to the following scheme. Let us suppose there is a double star of which one is revolving about the common centre of gravity in a circular orbit. Let us suppose, for instance, that we know the space-time " course " for any natural process whatsoever, as regards the manner in which it takes place in the Galileian domain relative to a Galileian body of reference K. By means of purely theoretical operations (i.e. Let us take a linear homogeneous transformation, X. r,. Let us take a simpler example.
Let us take a system of co-ordinates in which the equations of Newtonian mechanics hold good.2 In order to render our presentation more precise and to distinguish this system of co-ordinates verbally from others which will be introduced hereafter, we call it the Ostationary system. Let us take an example : We know that a magnet attracts pieces of iron. Let us take another ex- ample. Let us take another example, a case in which light passes through matter. Let us take ds as the magnitude of the line-element belonging to two infinitely near points in the four-dimensional region. Let us take the space time null-point in this, and by means of a Lorentz-transformation, we can take this axis as the /-axis. Let us think of the mutual action between a magi-net and a conductor.
Let us try to eliminate from our considerations everything which refers to the shape of the circuit, to its length, to the surface enclosed by the wire. Let us try to follow this new clue consistently. Let us view Planck's radiation formula as correct, and ask ourselves whether something concerning the composition of radiation can be derived from it. Let us" introduce for this purpose a third co-ordinate system k' , which is set in motion relative to the system h, the motion being parallel to the ^-axis. Let us, for the sake of briefness, call everything ex- cept quantum physics, classical physics. Let us, for the sake of simplicity, call the mass determined in the first way the inertial mass and that determined in the second way the gravitational mass.
Let us, however, pass over mis ditliculty for the moment. Let us, then, indicate two goals which may well be agreed upon by nearly ali who read these lines. Let us, therefore, try something different. Let w denote the space-time vector of the first kind (?^= velocity of matter), F the space-time vector of the second kind (M, ^E) (M = magnetic induction, E = Electric force, /the space-time vector af the second kind (w/, ?>) (y^^= magnetic force, (?= Electric Induction. Let x, y, z, /, denote the point B, let T"^ denote the proper time of B^, reckoned from O. Let your efforts in this struggle be unceasing. Let's assume that this is strictly true. Let's call this the constancy of the speed of light principle.
Let, for example, 'p e (pre/ p) ppg (2) where h is Planck's constant, po is some constant number, and x the independent variable. Letter to a Friend of Peace It has come to my ears that in your greatheartedness you are quietly accomplishing a splendid work, impelled by solicitude for humanity and its fate. Letter to an Arab March 15, 1930 Sir, Your letter has given me great pleasure. Life for him is always becoming, never being. Life in human society meant dangers of all sorts; but these dangers were chaotic in nature, subject to chance. Life is sacred that is to say, it is the supreme value, to which all other values are subordinate. Light and dark rings appear on the photo- graphic plate.
Light from the sun, seen through a spectroscope, gives a continuous spectrum; all wave-lengths are represented in it. Light gradually fades into the dark background in a series of light and dark rings. Light in a vacuum has a definite and constant velocity, independent of the velocity of its source. Light in empty space was explained as a matter of vibrations of the ether, and it seemed idle at that stage, of course, to look upon the latter as a conglomeration of material points. Light is conceived not as a manifestation of the state of some hypothetical medium, but rather as an independent entity like matter. Light passes through ether and also through glass and water, but its velocity is changed in the latter substances.
Light reaching our eyes from a moving light source would have a greater velocity if the motion is toward us and smaller if it is away from us. Light travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity w. How quickly does it travel in the direction of the arrow in the tube T (see the accompanying diagram, Fig. Light waves appear as undulatory electromagnetic .6.eld processes in space. Lightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment at two places A and B far distant from each other. Like every other theory in electrodynamics, the theory is based on the kinematics of rigid bodies; in the enunciation of every theory, Ave have to do with relations betw^een rigid bodies (co-ordinate system), clocks, and electromagnetic processes.
Like most writers at the time, I tried to frame a field-law for gravitation, since it was no longer possible, at least in any natural way, to intro- duce direct action at a distance owing to the abolition of the notion of absolute simultaneity. Likewise it might be imagmable that the q(PJ would bave to be taken, not as independent of one another, but as connected by conditional equations. Likewise, the great moral teachers of humanity were, in a way, artistic geniuses in the art of living. Links are added to the chain of logic connecting theory and observation. Little need be said about the quantitative side of the problem. Little will be gained without a thor? Lodge's experi- ment thus seems to show a complete absence of any viscous flow of ether.
Logica!thinking is necessarily deductive; it is based upon hypothetical concepts and axioms. Logically the problem seems to offer two possibilities, be? Long before men were ripe, namely, to be faced with such a universal moral attitude, fear of the dangers of life had led them to attribute to various imaginary persona! Look around, and look forward. Looked at in this light, men Iike Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza are closely akin to one another. Looked at in this light, men like Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza are closely akin to one another. Looked at in this way, space appears as something real in the same sense as solid bodies. Looking at a moving particle through a microscope one sees a very small part of the curve, which appears as a small segment.
Looking at the clock from a distance, for example by television, we have always to remember that what we see now really happened earlier, just as in viewing the setting sun we note the event eight minutes after it has taken place. Looking at water through even our most powerful microscopes we cannot see molecules and their motion as pictured by the kinetic theory of matter. Looking back over the development of physics we see that the ether, soon after its birth, became the enfant terrible of the family of physical substances. Lord Rayleigh, independently discovered the same phenomenon again in regard to tennis balls and also gave the cor- rect explanation.
Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued the theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body relative to the 34ther produces a contraction of the body in the direction of motion, the amount of contraction being just sufficient to compensate for the differeace in time mentioned above. Lorentz assumed that a moving dielectric merely carried away its own '' polarivsation doublets," which on his theory gave rise to the induced field proportional to K 1. Lorentz brought theory into harmony with experiment, and did it by a marvelous simplifi- cation of basic concepts. Lorentz established the Relativity Theoremt (consisting merely of a set of transformation equations) while Einstein generalised it into a Universal Principle.
Lorentz further succeeded in obtaining a value for the Fresnelian convection coefficient equal to 1 ^//a^, the exact value required by all optical experiments of the moving type. Lorentz had postulated the existence of electrons so early as 1878, but it was not until some years later that the electron theory became firmly established on a satisfac- tory basis. Lorentz has also devoted his energies to the service of inter? Lorentz has also devoted his energies to the service of international cultural ends in another way, by consenting to serve on the League of Nations Commission for international intellectual co-operation, which was called into existence some five years ago with Bergson as chairman.
Lorentz proceeded on the assumption that the electron shared in the Lorentz-Fitz2:erald eontrae- tion and obtained a totally di:fferent formula. Lorentz showed that if the ether were taken to be at rest and did not participate at all in the motions of matter, no other hypotheses were necessary to arrive at a theory that did justice to almost all of the phenomena. Lorentz showed that the Maxwell-Lorentz system of electromagnetic tield-equations remained practically unchanged by the Lorentz transformation. Lorentz theory of electro-dynamics. Lorentz thus succeeded in re- ducing all electro-magnetic phenomena to Maxwells equations for a field in vacuo. Lorentz transformations are for?
Lorentz used a special set of transformation equations"^ for time which implicitly introduced the concept of local time. Lorentz wanted to explain the Michelson-^NIorley null-effect. Lorentz worked on the hypothesis that an electron itself undergoes NOTES 169 contraction when moving. Lorentz's efforts resembled those of a doctor with a recalcitrant patient who refuses to take the medicines carefully prepared for his benefit. Luminous gases do not, therefore, emit photons with all possible energies, but only those characteristic of the substance. M. The changes become more distinct as the speed increases. M. There is really no reason for such sarcasm! M. Your question is best answered in the following way. MAHATMA GANDID On the occasion of Gandhi's seventieth birthday in 1939.

MINKOWSKI'S important contri- bution to the theory lies in the following: before Minkowski's inves- tigation it was necessary to carry out a Lorentz-transformation on a law in order to test its invariance under such transformations; he, on the other hand, succeeded in introducing a for- malism such that the mathematical form of the law itself guarantees its invariance under Lorentz-transforma- tions.

Mach did indeed try to avoid the necessity of postulating an imperceptible real entity, by substitu- ting in mechanics a mean velocity with respect to the totality of masses in the world for acceleration with respect to absolute space. Mach did indeed try to avoid the necessity of postulating an imperceptible real entity, by substitu- ting in mechanics a mean velocity with respect to the totality of masses in the world for acceleration with respect to absolute space. Machs ether not only conditions the behavior of inert masses but is also conditioned, as regards its state, by them.
Machs ether not only conditions the behaviour of inert masses, but is also conditioned in its state by them. Machs idea finds its full development in the ether of the general theory of relativity. Machs notion finds its full development in the ether of the general theory of relativity. Magnus confirmed his explanation by experi- ments with a rotating cylinder which was not ma- terially different from a Fljettner cylinder. Making this change of sign one finds as the required solution. Man acquires at birth, through heredity, a biologica !con? Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting himself to society. Man can imagine a fourth dimension mathematically, but he cannot see it, he cannot visualize it, he can not represent it physically.
Man has an intense desire for assured knowledge. Man has not succeeded in developing politica! Man is in the same position, as the unfortunate bedbug, except that he is three- dimensional. Man is, at one and the same time, a solitary being and a socia!being. Man like every other animai is by nature indolent. Man should not bave to work for tbe achievement of tbe necessities of life to sucb an extent that be bas neither time nor strengtb for personal activities. Man should not have to work for the achievement of the necessities of life to such an extent that he has neither time nor strength for personal activities. Man sought to alter the disposi? Man sought to alter the disposition of these gods in his own favor by means of magie and prayer.
Man tries to make for himself in the fashion that suits him best a simplified and intelligible picture of the world ; he then tries to some extent to substitute this cosmos of his for the world of experience, and thus to overcome it. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear and punishment and hope of reward after death. Man would not bave killed man, tortured each other, exploited each other by force and by guile. Man's plight would, indeed, be sad if he had to be kept in order through fear of punishment and hope of rewards after death. Mankind can only gain protection against the danger of unimaginable destruction and wanton annihilation if a supranational organization has alone the authority to produce or possess these weapons.
Mankind is caught up in a struggle for adaptation to these new conditions-a struggle that may bring true liberation, if our generation shows itself equal to the task. Mans thirst for knowledge only acquiesces in such a dualism reluctantly. Many a sincere person will answer me: "Our attitude towards Negroes is the result of unf avorable experiences which we have had by living side by side with Negroes in this country. Many a young man goes to this valley with his hopes fixed on the healing power of its sunny mountains and regains his bodily health. Many attempts have been made to explain this phenomenon, and I am not sure whether anything I say in the following pages will be new to the expert; some of the relevant considerations are in any case known.
Many instances of this kind will be found in the following pages of this book, where the importance ofseeing known facts in a new light will be stressed and new theories described. Many physicists maintain ^and there are weighty arguments in their favor ^that in the face of these facts not merely the differential law but the law of causation itself ^hitherto the fundamental postulate of all natural science has collapsed. Many readers may ask: "What right has he to speak out about things which concern us alone, and which no newcomer should touch?"
Many take to science out of a joyful sense of superior intellectual power; science is their own special sport to which they look for vivid experience and the satisfaction of ambition; many others are to be found in the temple who have offered the products of their brains on this altar for purely utilitarian purposes. Many who think themselves good pacifists will jib at this out-and-out pacifism, on patriotic grounds. Mascart, Hoek, Maxwell and others sought for definite changes in different optical effects induced by the motion of the earth relative to the stationary ether. Mass can be detected by means of scales, but what of heat? Mass is de:fined by the resistance that a body opposes to its accelera? Mass psychology is a difficult thing to fathom.
Masses which are sufficiently far from each other and from other bodies are then, with respect to K, free from acceleration. Mathematically, we can characterise the generalised Lorentz transformation thus : It expresses x', y', x', t', in terms of linear homogeneous functions of x, y, x, t, of such a kind that the relation x'2 + y'2 + z'2 - c2t'2 = x2 + y2 + z2 - c2t2 (11a). Mathematics as a tool of reasoning is necessary if we wish to draw conclusions which may be compared with experiment. Matter appeared as the bearer of the field, not space. Matter appears as the substratum not only of velocities, kinetic energy, and mechanical forces of gravity, but also of electro-magnetic fields. Matter has a granular structure; it is composed of elementary particles, the elementary quanta of matter.
Matter has weight but energy is weightless. Matter is where energy concentration is great; field is where it is small. Matter would then be regions where the field is extremely strong. MatterN considered as atoms N is the only seat of electric charges; between the material particles there is empty space, the seat of the electromag- netic field, which is created by the position and velocity of the point charges which are located on the material particles. Max well, who mathematically proved the existence of electric waves, and Hertz, who first created them with the help of a spark. Max- wells equations are the simplest L o r e n t z-invariant field equations which can be postulated for an anti- symmetric tensor derived from a vec- tor field.
Maxwell did, indeed, try to explain, or justify, these equations by intellectual constructions. Maxwell succeeded in giving a fairly .satisfactory account of all ordinary optical phenomena and little room was left for any serious doubts as regards the general validity of Maxwell's theory. Maxwell's Electro-Magnetic field-equations. Maxwell's equations are laws representing the structure of the field. Maxwell's equations describe the structure of the electromagnetic field. Maxwell's equations determine the electromagnetic field when the distribution of electric charges and currents is known. Maxwell's equations enable us to follow the history of the field, just as the mechanical equations enabled us to follow the history of material particles.
Maxwell's laws were also generalized to apply to any c.s., like the gravitational laws. May every one of them fully realize the importance of this work and contribute, according to his powers, to its success! May he succeed in uniting the quantum theory and electro- dynamics in a single logical system. May his example contribute to the triumph of that spirit ! May his example contribute to the triumph of that spiriti B. May it prosper, enriching the inner lives of numbers of admirable human beings and rescuing many from the poverty of sanatorium life! May it prosper, enriching the inner lives of numbers of valuable human beings and rescu? May not entire beavenly bodies fare likewise ? May our united efforts succeed in building a bridge of mutual trust between the nations!
May the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive thought! May the conscience and the common sense of the peoples be awakened, so that we may reach a new stage in the life of nations, where people will look back on war as an incomprehensible aberration of their forefathers! May the land of Palestine come to mean to us and to our children what the Temple of Solomon meant to our ancestors! May the love of science continue to illumine his path in the future and lead him to the solution of the most important problem in present-day physics, which he has himself posed and done so much to solve. May the present upheavals lead to a better world. May the spirit of brotherly understanding gain ground more and more among them.
May the spirit of brotherly understanding gain more and more ground among them. May the time soon come when this nationalism will have become so thoroughly a matter of course that it will no longer be necessary for us to give it special emphasis. May they succeed through timely agree? May we not then regard those traditional covariances for c'= oo only as an approximation consistent with experience, the actual covariance of natural laws holding for a certain finite value of e. I may here point out that by if instead of the Newtonian Relativity-Postulate with c~oc^ we assume a relativity- postulate with a finite c, then the axiomatic construction of Mechanics appears to gain considerably in perfection. May we soon succeed in making permanent progress by our united efforts!
May you succeed in activating the young generation in this sense, so that it wilI strive for a policy of peace on a grand scale. Me reduce (52) with reference to the indices /x and o- and subtract the equation so obtained after multiplication with i B from (52). Mean displacements of lines towards the less refrangible end of the spectrum are certainly revealed by statistical investigations of the fixed stars ; but up to the present the examination of the available data does not allow of any definite decision being arrived at, as to whether or not these displacements are to be referred in reality to the effect of gravitation.
Means of communication, finally-reproduction processes for the printed word, and the radio-when combined with modem weapons, have made it possible to piace body and soul under bondage to a centrai authority-and bere is a third source of danger to mankind. Meantime, it took physicists some decades to grasp the full significance of Maxrwels discovery, so bold was the leap that his genius forced upon the conceptions of his fellow-workers. Meanwhile the body remains at rest with respect to the system (x,y,z). Meanwhile the great stumbling-block for a field- theory of this kind lies in the conception of the atomic structure of matter and energy. Meanwhile we oifer the followino^ extract from the above mentioned work of Sommerfdd.
Mechanical means of production in an unorganized economy have had the result that a substantial proportion of mankind is no longer needed for the production of goods and is thus excluded from the process of economie circulation.

Memory, the capacity to make new combinations, the gift of oral communication have made possible developments among human being which are not dictated by biological necessities. Men Jike him are needed if we are ever to build up a healthy politica! Men in their distress begin to think about the failure of economie practice and about the necessity of political combinations which are supernational.
Men like him are needed if we are ever to build up a healthy political society. Men of standing would do a great service to humanity by endorsing the refusal our young men to perform military service. Men of t11is kind can aid in tl1e great work of restoring tbe intemational societies to health by keeping in dose touch with like-minded people all aver tl1e world, and steadfastly championing the intemational cause in their own spheres. Mercury, being the planet nearest to the sun, has the strongest attraction. Metals, the earth, the human body, are all examples of conductors, although not equally good.
Mic/iehov-Morley Eopperiment.In 1881, Michelson and Morley performed their classical experiments which undermined the whole structure of the old ether theory and thus served to introduce the new theory of relativity. Michelson and Morley repeated their experi- ment at different heights from the surface of the earth, but invariably obtained the same negative results, thus failing to confirm Stokes' theory of viscous How. Michelson's experiment suggests the axiom that all phenomena obey the same laws relative to the Earth's reference frame or, more generally, relative to any reference frame in unaccelerated motion. Military means of defense should be interna? Minkowski begins here with tlie case of lor S, where S is a six- vector (space-time vector of the 2nd kind).
Minkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy the following simple conditions. Minkowski's Four-Dimensional Space ("World"). Minkowski's work is doubtless difficult of access to anyone inexperienced in mathematics, but since it is not necessary to have a very exact grasp of this work in order to understand the fundamental ideas of either the special or the general theory of relativity, I shall leave it here at present, and revert to it only towards the end of Part 2. Minorities It seems to be a universal fact that minorities especially when the individuals composing them are distinguished by physical peculiarities are treated by the majorities among whom they live as an inferior order of beings.

Modem tyrannies and their destructive effects show plainly how far we are from exploit? Modem weapons, in particular the atom bomb, have led to a considerable advantage in the means of offense or attack over those of defense.
Modern anthropology has taught us, through comparative investigation of so-called primitive cultures, that the social behavior of human beings may differ greatly, depending upon prevailing cultural patterns and the types of organization which predominate in society. Modern physics formulates the answer rather differently for the following reason. Modern physics has attacked all these problems and solved them. MolecularTheoretic Investigation of the Dependence of the Entropy of Gases and Dilute solutions on the volume In the calculation of entropy by moleculartheoretic methods we frequently use the word OprobabilityO in a sense differing from that employed in the calculus of probabilities. Money only appeals to selfishness and always tempts its owners irresistibly to abuse it.
Money only appeals to selfshness and irresistibly invites abuse. Moral authority alone is an inadequate means of securing the peace. Morality in the sense here briefly indicated is not a fixed and stark system. More accurately speaking, it allows athe treatment of the problem of motion of materia! More artificial theories have been tried out, assuming that the real truth lies somewhere between these two limiting cases: that the ether is only partially carried by the moving bodies. More careful consideration shows, however, that this anxiety is unfounded. More careful reflection teaches us, however, that the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether. More dreadful even than the destruction, in my opinion, is the humiliating slavery into which war plunges the individual.
More emphasis is laid on the "we" than the "I." More generally, it is shown in quantum me- chanics that, if the operators corresponding to two physical quantities, say A and B, do not commute, that is, if AB/BA, then the precise knowledge of one of them precludes such a knowledge of the other. More heat in the vessel means a greater ^verageTffietic energy. More papers followed, and Einstein returned to teaching, in Zurich, was elected a member of the American Acad in Prague, and eventually in Berlin, where an emy of Arts & Sciences in 1924. appointment in 1914 to the Prussian Academy of Sciences allowed him to concentrate on recent of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921, he search.
More pedantically a physicist formulates the same conclusion : the acceleration of a falling body increases in proportion to its gravitational mass and decreases in proportion to its inertial mass. More tban that, be showed convincingly that SAGE IN HONOR OF MORRIS RAPHAEL COHEN 79 in addition to the atomistic structure of matter there is a kind of atomistic structure to energy, govemed by the universal con? Moreover I believed that I could show on general considerations that a law of gravitation invariant in relation to any trans- formation of co-ordinates whatever was inconsistent with the principle of causation.
Moreover the trouble in Germany seems to me to be not hypertrophy of the machinery of production but deficient purchasing power in a large section of the population, which has been cast out of the productive process through rationalization. Moreover, I soon dis- covered the cruelty of that chase, which in those years was much more carefully covered up by hypocrisy and glittering words than is the case today. Moreover, Newton himself fully realized that time and space were essential elements, as physically e:ffective factors, of his system, if only by implication. Moreover, according to the special principle of relativity, this interpretation is quite justified also from a physical point of view.
Moreover, at this stage the definition of the space co-ordinates also presents insurmountable difficulties. Moreover, his position in society is such that the egotistical drives of his make-up are constantly being accentuated, while his social drives, which are by nature weaker, progressively deteriorate. Moreover, his task is not to explain just one case, but all phenomena which have happened or may still happen. Moreover, in thinking about the immediate future of theoretical physics we cannot unconditionally dismiss the possibility that the facts summarized in the quantum theory may set im- passable limits to the field theory. Moreover, it has shattered the whole framework of classi?
Moreover, it is unsatisfactory in any case to introduce into the discussion material points of quite a different sort, which had to be postulated for the purpose of repre- senting ponderable matter and light respectively. Moreover, it was possible to satisfy the stomach by such participation, but not man in so far as he is a thinking and feeling being. Moreover, it would be much easier for two countries which had agreed to compulsory arbitration for the settlement of all disputes arising out of their mutual relations to combine their military establishments of mercenaries into a single organization with a mixed staff. Moreover, one has the impression that the production of X-rays at P1 and the production of secondary cathode rays at P2 are essentially inverse processes.
Moreover, questions as to the OseatO of electrodynamic electromotive forces (unipolar machines) now have no point. Moreover, such an assumption will also have to be made about the statistical laws for absorption, (B) and (B'). Moreover, the Academy has reason to know that Herr Einstein, who according to his own statement has taken no part in atrocitymongering, has at least done nothing to counteract unjust suspicions and slanders, which, in the opinion of the Academy, it was his duty as one of its senior members to do. Moreover, the considerations of Section 6 are based on yet a second assumption, which, in the light of a strict consideration, appears to be arbitrary, although it was always tacitly made even before the introduction of the theory of relativity.
Moreover, the difference K0?K1, like the kinetic energy of the electron ( 10), depends on the velocity.

Moreover, the plane is finite with respect to the discshadows, since only a finite number of the shadows can find room on the plane.
Moreover, the results of our measurings are nothing but verifications of such meetings of the material points of our measuring instruments with other material points, coincidences between the hands of a clock and points on the clock dia!, and observed point-events happening at the same place at the same time. Moreover, the spherical surface is a finite continuum. Moreover, the trouble in Germany seems to me to be net hyper? Moreover, the water at the surface will come from the left-hand wall, and will therefore, on the left- hand side especially, be moving less rapidly than the water rather lower down. Moreover, this theory shares with the corpuscular theory of light the unusual property that light carries inertial mass from the emitting to the absorbing object.

Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). Moreover, we see that the mass constant m of the neutra! Moreover, what is meant here by motion "in space" ? Most ikely all sociable animals bave arrived at this primitive kind of communication- at least to a certain degree. Most important, however, seems to me to be the result concerning the momentum transfer to the molecule due to the absorption and emission of radiation. Most likely all sociable animals have arrived at this primitive kind of communication at least to a certain degree.
Most mistakes in philosophy and logic occur because the human mind is apt to take the symbol for the reality. Most objects are gained by gradual steps: for example, the supersession of absolute monarchy by democracy. Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone. Most of the papers in that collection are English translations by W. Perrett and G.B. Most of them are constructive. Most of them are somewhat odd, uncommunicative, solitary fel- lows, really less like each other, in spite of these common characteristics, than the hosts of the re- jected. Most of these materials may have already disappeared by radio-active disintegration. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.
Most people would lead a dull life of slavery just as under the ancient despotisms of Asia. Motion is never observable as "motion with respect to space" or, as it has been expressed, as "absolute motion." Motion of the Perihelion of a Planetary Orbit. Moving Measuring Rods and Clocks.

Mter the cooperation of the nations of highest military importance has been secured, the attempt should be made to incorporate, if possible, all nations into the supranational organization, provided that it is their voluntary decision to join.
Much more complicated forces could be imagined, such as those which might depend not only on the distance but also on the velo- cities of the two particles. Much remains to be done, but one at least of Herzl's aims has already been realized: its task in Palestine has given the Jewish people an astonishing degree of solidarity and the optimism without which no organism can lead a healthy life. Much the same often applies to the theoretical physicist when the experimental physicist calls him in. Much will depend on what results this forced experiment produces. Much will depend on what results this mighty experiment produces.
Multiplication of Tensors Outer Multiplication of Tensors.-We obtain from tbe com ponents of a tensor of rank n and of a tensor of rank m the components of a tensor of rank n + m by multiplying each component of the one tensor by each component of the other. Multiplying by the velocity, a tensor of rank 1, we obtain the tensor equation ? Munich, Aril 8, 1933 From the Bavarian Academy of Sciences to Professor Albert Einstein. Music and physical research work originate in different sources, but they are interrelated through their common aim, which is the desire to express the unknown. Must not all those forces that determine the life of man be regarded as constant compared with such a trifilng interval?

Mv DEAR Sm: Two of the most eminent and respected men of science in Italy have applied to me in their difficulties of conscience and requested me to write to you with the object of preventing, if possible, a cruel hardship with which men of leaming are threatened in Italy. My dear Children, I rejoice to see you before me to-day, happy youth of a sunny and fortunate land.
My dear Sir, Two of the most eminent and respected men of science in Italy have applied to me in their difficulties of conscience and requested me to write to you with the object of preventing, if possible, a piece of cruel persecution with which men of learning are threatened in Italy. My defense: all our thinking is of this nature of a free play with concepts; the justification for this play lies in the measure of survey over the ex- perience of the senses which we are able to achieve with its aid. My experience teaches me that this idealistic outlook is particu!arly prevalent in America, which is decried as a singu? My experience teaches me that this idealistic outlook is particularly prevalent in America, which is usually decried as a particularly materialistic country.
My final word to you is that those who are ambitious and sincerely dedicated to the cause of universal peace must have the courage to start, to initiate, and to carry on so fearlessly that the whole world will be forced to consider what they are doing! My major aim in this was to find facts which would guarantee as much as possible the existence of atoms of definite finite size. My major question was: what general conclusions can be drawn from the radia- tion-formula concerning the structure of radiation and even more generally concerning the electromagnetic foundation of phys- ics? My master thought about it very carefully, and decided that the only way out is to assume the existence of a hypothetical substance, the ether, a transparent medium permeating the entire universe.
My only aim to-day has been to show that the human faculty of visualisation is by no means bound to capitulate to non-Euclidean geometry. My opinion regarding this issue, recently expressed at this place, was erroneous. My original considerations on the subject were based on two hypotheses: (1) There exists an average density of matter in the whole of spacewhich is everywhere the same and different from zero. My own case is, alas, an illustration. My own interest in those years was less concerned with the detailed consequences of Planck's results, how- ever important these might be. My part in it was quite indirect.
My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my pronounced freedom from the need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. My personal opinion is that those methods are in generai pref? My personal opinion is that those methods are preferable which respect existing traditions and habits so far as that is in any way compatible with the end in view. My political ideal is that of democracy. My proposed field equations of gravitation for any chosen system of co-ordinates run as follows :- G,... = G,... = - tc(T,... - tg,...T), } {v, a} + {a, /3} { v/3, a) _ (l3) + 2log ,.j - g - {v, a} log ,.j g x,.. x .
My religious feeling is a humble amazement at the order revealed in the small patch of reality to which our feeble intelligence is equal. My view is that these are convincing proofs of the physical correctness of my theory. N One complete revolution corresponds to the angle 2! N denotes the number of Oreal moleculesO in a gram equivalent, and T the absolute temperature. N ever did he give the impression of domineering, always of serving and helping. N spite of its great success in various fields, the present theoretical physics is still far from being able to provide a unified foundation on which the theoretical treatment of all phenomena could be based. N. That is not as simple as it seems.
NIELS BOHR When a later generation comes to write the history of the progress made in physics in our time, it will have to connect one of the most important advances ever made in our knowledge of the nature of the atom with the name of Niels Bohr. NOTES 173 Let the observer be in the plane of the orbit^ at a great distance A. NOTES 181 We see easily that this coincides with the usual rule for the vector-product; c. g., iov j ^c. NOTES J 75 The representation of the plane (defined by two strai^'ht lines) is much more difficult. NOTES ON THE ORIGIN OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY I GLADLY accede to the request that I should say something about the history of my own scientific work. Na ve realism leads to physics, and phys?
Naive realism leads to physics, and physics, if true, shows that naive realism is false. Naively, we might imagine a particle with a surface separating it from its field. Namely, if the man in the carriage covers the distance w in a unit of time N measured from the train, N then this distance N as measured from the embankment N is not necessarily also equal to w. Footnotes 1) e.g. Namely, the original field equations admit a solution in which the " world radius " depends on time (expanding space). Namely, then all molecules are assembled in the first cell; for this state there is only a single distribution of the molecules when adopting our way of counting. Nationalities of different race seem to have an instinct which prevents them from fusing.
Nationalities want to pursue their own path, not to blend. Nations that once ranked high bow down before tyrants who dare openly to assert: Right is that which serves usi The quest for truth for its own sake has no justifcation and is not to be tolerated. Nations usually survive these distempers. Naturally they should be entitled to pro? Nature herself comes to our aid. Nature herself reproduces the same result in the beautiful colour scheme of the rainbow. Nature scatters her common wares with a lavish hand, but the choice sort she produces but seldom. Nature, in fact, places at our disposal a system moving with a fairly high velocity the earth in its yearly motion around the sun. Nay more, has this right way any existence outside our illusions?
Nearly every great advance in science arises from a crisis in the old theory, through an endeavour to find a way out of the difficulties created. Needless to say, one is glad that religion strives to work for the realization of the moral principle. Neglect of science leads to a subsequent dearth of intellectual workers able, in virtue of their independent outlook and judgment, to blaze new trails for industry or adapt themselves to new situations. Neglecting magnitudes of fourth and higher orders we may place ?
Neglecting the important individual results which Clerk Maxwells life-work produced in important de- partments of physics, and concentrating on the changes wrought by him in our conception of the nature of physical reality, we may say this : Before Clerk Maxwell people conceived of physical reality in so far as it is supposed to represent events in nature ^as material points, whose changes consist exclusively of motions, which are subject to partial differential equations. Neither any direct conhrmation nor a direct refutation is possible and it does not throw any light on the various optical pheno- mena. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts.
Neither is allowed to use arguments developed after the work of the two great masters was finished. Neither the religion of fear nor the social- moral religion can have any hold on him. Never again, throughout the whole course of the motion, will it reach the same height. Never forget that the fruit of our labor does not constitute an end in itself. Never have I made any systematic effort to ameliorate the lot of men, HUMAN RIGHTS 35 to fight injustice and suppression, and to improve the traditional forms of human relations. Never yet have I experienced from the fair sex such energetic rejection of ali advances; or if I have, never from so many at once. Never yet have I experienced from the fair sex such energetic rejection of all advances; or, if I have, never from so many at once.
Neverthe- less, for anyone who experiences it for the first time, it is marvelous enough that man is capable at all of reaching such a degree of certainty and purity in pure thinking as the Greeks showed us for the first time to be possible in geometry. Nevertheless A is supposed to satisfy a certain statistical law, such that its average value vanishes. Nevertheless I am fully confident that the approach chosen here is a reliable one. Nevertheless it is a good example showing the characteristic features of every physical theory. Nevertheless much can be lifted out of one's own experience which is not open to another consciousness. Nevertheless no one doubts that we are confronted with a causal connection whose causa!components are in the main known to us.
Nevertheless one cannot assert that Eqs (3) are satisfied by (1) for at finite values of xI,,x4. Nevertheless one should not exclude a priori the possibility that the theory may contain them. Nevertheless there is visible in this process of relatively fruitless but heroic endeavours a systematic trend of development, namelyEan increasing scepticism concerning every attempt by means of pure thought to learn something about the "objective world,"a about the world of "things" in contrast to the world of mere "concepts and ideas." Nevertheless this so-called mechanical view, most clearly formulated by Helmholtz, played an important role in its time. Nevertheless we can well imagine that another system, based on different assumptions, might work just as well.
Nevertheless we must now draw attention to the fact that a theory of this phenomenon was given by H. A. Lorentz long before the statement of the theory of relativity. Nevertheless, having found nobody who thoroughly understood the elementary principles involved, I think it is proper for me to give the following short qualitative exposition of them. Nevertheless, if such an experiment could be devised it would be crucial in deciding between the wave theory and the corpuscular theory of light. Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism. Nevertheless, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by oir.
Nevertheless, the space-distribution of this gravitational field is of a kind that would not be possible on Newton's theory of gravitation.1) But since the observer believes in the general theory of relativity, this does not disturb him; he is quite in the right when he believes that a general law of gravitation can be formulated- a law which not only explains the motion of the stars correctly, but also the field of force experienced by himself. Nevertheless, the velocity is not uniform, for the path is not a straight line. Nevertheless, there are many experiments which show a small deviation from the mechanical laws, and their consistency can be regarded as proof of the rota- tion of the earth.
Nevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset speak very much in favour of the validity of the principle of relativity. Nevertheless, there is still a possible way out, without resigning as suggested under (b). Nevertheless, to the cry of the Ort and Oze Societies I have been unable to turn a deaf ear, for it is at the same time, as it were, the cry of our heavily burdened people, to whose voice I respond. Nevertheless, we must assume that despite all e:fforts Russia and her allies may still :6.nd it advisable to stay out of such a world govemment. Nevertheless, with respect to this question, I believe that we stand at the beginning of a development of the greatest importance that cannot yet be surveyed.
Nevertlieless no one doubts tliat we are confronted witli a causai connection whose causai components are in tlie main known to us. New difficulties arising in the development of science force our theory to become more and more abstract. New facts appear, contradicting the theory or unex- plained by it. New kinds of substances had to be invented: two electric fluids and the elementary magnetic dipoles. New tensors, in respect to linear orthogonal transformations, may be formed from tensors according to these rules of operation. New- tons theory certainly marks the greatest step ever taken in linking up natural phenomena causally.
Newton could equally well have called his absolute space the ether; the only thing that matters is that in addition to observable objects another imperceptible entity has to be regarded as real, in order for it to be possible to regard acceleration, or rotation, as something real. Newton found this also in the differential and the integral calculus. Newton had framed his laws of motion in such a way as to make them quite independent of the absolute velocity * See Note 2. t See Note 4. Newton himself tried to apply this scheme to optics, assuming light to consist of inert corpuscles. Newton meets this objection by point- ing to the fact that his law of reciprocal gravitation is not supposed to be a final explanation but a rule derived by induction from experience.
Newton might no less well have called his absolute space Ether; what is essential is merely that besides observable objects, another thing, which is not perceptible, must be looked upon as real, to enable acceleration or rotation to be looked upon as something real. Newton recog- nized that the motions of falling stones, of the moon, and of planets are only very special manifestations of a universal gravitational force acting between any two bodies. Newton showed by experiment that it is indeed possible to obtain white light from its spectrum and the spectrum from white light in this simple way as many times as one pleases. Newton was probably first to reveal, in his theory of sound-transmission, the efficacy of partial differential equations.
Newton wrote in his Principle, : An impressed force is an action exerted upon a body, in order to change its state, either of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a right line. Newton's Theory as a First Approximation. Newton's emission theory of light seems to contain more truth with respect to this point than the oscillation theory since, first of all, the energy given to a light particle is not scattered over infinite space, but remains available for an elementary process of absorption. Newton's gravitational law connects the motion of a body here and now with the action of a body at the same time in the far distance. Newton's gravitational theory gave an example, by restricting itself to the pure mechanics of gravitation.
Newton's law connecting the force with the change of velocity will, therefore, be valid in both c.s. Newton's law is valid only in the inertial c.s. Newton's law still remains the basis of all astronomical calculations. Newton's recipe is: if the inertial principle is valid, then the c.s. Newton's theory as a first approximation. Newton, the first creator of a comprehensive and workable system of theoretical physics, still believed that the basic concepts and laws of his system could be derived from experience; his phrase 'hypotheses non fingo' can only be interpreted in this sense. Newton, the first creator of a comprehensive, workable system of theoretical physics, still believed that the basic concepts and laws of his system could be derived from experience.
Newtonian mechanics does not give a satisfactory answer to this question. Newtons acceleration is only thinkable or de- finable in relation to space as a whole. Newtons doctrine of motion, considered as the key idea of the whole of theoretical physics, received its first shock from Clerk Maxwells theory of electricity. Newtons equations of motion were the sole basis of the kinetic theory of heat, which not only prepared peoples minds for the discovery of the law of the conservation of energy but also led to a theory of gases which has been confirmed down to the last detail, and a mofe profound view of the nature of the second law of thermodynamics.
Newtons fundamental principles were so satisfac- tory from the logical point of view that the impetus to overhaul them could only spring from the imperious demands of empirical fact. Newtons object was to answer the question: Is there such a thing as a simple rule by which one can calculate the movements of the heavenly bodies in our planetary system completely, when the state of motion of all these bodies at .one moment is known? Newtons teaching provided no explanation for the highly remarkable fact that the weight and the inertia of a body are determined by the same quantity (its mass). Newtons theory is probably the greatest stride ever made in the effort towards the causal nexus of natural phenomena.
Next come the special and general theories of relativity, which, though based entirely on ideas connected with the field-theory, have so far been unable to avoid the independent introduction of material points and total differential equations. No Jew can truly sense this meaning un less he joyfully contributes his share to the Jewish work, the Jewish cause. No absolute uniform motion exists in classical physics. No analogy with a sound wave is possible and the conclusions drawn in the case of a sound wave do not hold for a light wave. No answer canbe admit ted as epistemologically satisfactory,* u nless the reason given is a.n observable fact of experience. No assumption about gravitational force dependence on distance is needed. No clear boundary separates matter and field.
No country can avoid this corruption. No current flows through the wire, for no source is present. No dependence of the speed of light upon direction could be found. No doubt the great materialists of ancient Greece had insisted that all material events should be traced back to a strictly regular series of atomic movements, without admitting any living creature's will as an independent cause. No doubt, it will be achieved, but nobody can say when. No doubt, such a person loses some of his innocence and unconcern; on the other hand, he is largely independent of the opinions, habits, and judgments of his fel? No doubt, the antagonism of eco?
No doubt, the day will come when all nations ( as far as such nations still exist ) will be grateful to Russia for having demonstrated, for the :6.rst time, by vigorous action the practical possibility of planned economy in spite of exceedingly great diflculties. No electric current is present so long as the field does not change, no matter how great its strength. No event of the last few years reflects such disgrace on the leading civilized countries of the world as the failure of all disarmament conferences so far; for this failure is due not only to the intrigues of ambitious and unscrupulous politicians, but also to the indifference and slackness of the public in all countries.
No fairer destiny could be allotted to any physical theory, than that it should of itself point out the way to the introduction of a more comprehensive theory, in which it lives on as a limiting case. No finite force, no matter how great, can cause an increase in speed beyond this limit. No international organization can be stronger than the constitutional powers given it, or than its component parts want it to be. No matter from which angle we approach the subject, or what crucial experiment we may devise, the verdict is always against the assumption of the ether carried by motion.
No matter how definitely it has been proved that heat is to be explained by molecular movement, we have never- theless to admit today that our position in regard to the fundamental laws of this motion resembles that of astronomers before Newton in regard to the motions of the planets. No matter how much one may admire the acute analysis which Russell has given us in his latest book on M eaning and Truth, it still seems to me that even there the specter of the metaphysical fear has caused some damage. No matter how much one may admire the acute analysis which Russell has given us in his latest book on Meaning and Truth, it still seems to me that even there the spectre of the metaphysical fear has caused some damage. No one doubted the sacredness of the goal.
No one has observed a place e, cept at a pariicnlar iime, or has obserred a time exce^A at a particular place. No one humbles himself before another person or class. No one must think that Newton's great creation can be overthrown in any real sense by this or by any other theory. No one of the assumptions can be isolated for separate testing. No one who does not appreciate the terrific exertions, and, above all, the devotion without which pioneer creations in scientific thought cannot come into being, can judge the strength of the feeling out of which alone such work, turned away as it is from immediate practical life, can grow. No one would have been taken seriously who failed to acknowledge the quest for objective truth and knowledge as man's highest and eternai aim.
No other theory has satisfactorily explained the facts of aberration, the propagation of light in moving bodies (Fizeau), and phenomena observed in double stars (De Sitter). No purpose is so high that unworthy methods in achieving it can be justiled in my eyes. No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this. No sleight of hand can reconcile the unlimited sovereignty of the individual country with security against attack. No space and no portion of space without gravitational potentials; for these give it its metrical properties without which it is not thinkable at all. No such distinct change as the vanishing and appearance of a new picture could possibly occur for a longitudinal wave.
No two elements have identical systems of stripes in their characteristic spectra, just as no two persons have exactly identical finger-prints. No wonder there is no lack of prophets who prophesy the early eclipse of our civilization. No, he has to persist in his helpless attitude towards the separate results of empirical research, until principles which he can make the basis of deductive reasoning have revealed themselves to him. No, something quite diHerent is involved. NoTE.-lt is convenient to treat the scalar (or invariant) both as a contravariant and a covariant tensor of zero rank. Nobody can imagine this thing, he cries indignantly. Nobody could bope ever to "perceive directly" an atom.
Nobody who has really gone deeply into the matter will deny that in practice the world of phenomena uniquely determines the theoretical system, in spite of the fact that there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles ; this is what Leibnitz described so happily as a pre-established harmony. Nobody would want to deny that the influence of the eco? Nobody, certainly, will deny that the idea of the existence of an omnipotent, just and omnibenefcent persona! Nobody, certainly, will deny that the idea of the existence of an omnipotent, just, and omnibeneficent personal God is able to accord man salace, help, and guidance; also, by virtue of its simplicity it is accessible to the most undeveloped mind.
Non-physical thought knows nothing of forces acting at a distance. None of these three points can rank as a logical ob- jection to the theory. Nor can one predict when materials more com? Nor do I believe that a sudden transference of economy into governmental man? Nor do I believe that a sudden transference of the control of industry to the hands of the public would be beneficial from the point of view of production; private enterprise should be left its sphere of activity, in so far as it has not already been eliminated by industry itself in the form of cartelization. Nor do I believe that the vast private corporations of the United States are suitable to the needs of these times.
Nor do we know whether it is only in the proximity of ponderable masses that its structure differs essentially from that of the Lorentzian ether; whether the geometry of spaces of cosmic extent is approximately Euclidean. Nor do we know whether its structure only differs materially from that of Lorentzs in the proximity of ponder- able masses, whether, in fact, the geometry of spaces of cosmic extent is, taken as a whole, almost Euclid- ean. Nor does it take account of the actual distribution of power. Nor may the reasons for this curious change be sought in my own extemal circumstances; for I know that these have always played a subordinate part in my thoughts and emotions.
Nor shall I attempt to analyse further the properties of space which justify the conception of continuous series of points, or lines. Nor was it necessary to delay the proposed measures against Franco-Spain. Nor would it be difficult to represent the case of what is called elliptical geometry in an analogous manner. Not acquainted with the earlier inves- tigations of Boltzmann and Gibbs, which had appeared earlier and ac- tually exhausted the subject, I devel- oped the statistical mechanics and the molecular-kinetic theory of therm- odynamics which was based on the former.
Not every such tensor allows itself to be formed in accordance with (8) from two four-vectors, but it is easily shown that any given sixteen A" can be represented as the sums of the ABv of four appropriately selected pairs of four-vectors. Not every such tensor can be built from two four- vectors, (according to 8). Not heat alone, but heat and other forms of energy taken together are, like a substance, indestructible. Not long ago I discovered a derivation of Planck's formula which was closely related to Wien's original argument * and which was based on the fundamental assumption of quantum theory. Not one number, but a pair of numbers corresponds to every point on the plane; a definite point corresponds to every pair of numbers.
Not only does a body resist a change more strongly if the rest mass is greater, but also if its velocity is greater. Not only does he have an explanation for the clues at hand, but he knows that certain other events must have happened. Not only does the machinery depend on traditional modes of feeling and owe its origin and its survival to them, but the existing machinery in its turn exercises a powerful influence on national modes of feeling. Not only the practical geometry of Euclid, but also its nearest generalisation, the practical geometry of Riemann, and therewith the general theory of relativity, rest upon this assumption.
Not only the speed of light, but also other field phenomena would show a dependence on the direction in the moving c.s., if the theory of the ether-sea were assumed. Not only was he brilliant as an inventor of certain key methods, but he also had a unique com- mand of the empirical material available in his day, and he was marvelously inventive as regards mathe- matical and physical methods of proof in individual cases. Not properties but probabilities are described, not laws dis- closing the future of systems are formulated, but laws governing the changes in time of the probabilities and relating to great congregations of individuals.
Not that I have an exaggerated notion of the importance of my own efforts, but to write the his- tory of other mens work demands a degree of ab- sorption in other peoples ideas which is much more in the line of the trained historian ; to throw light on ones own earlier thinking appears incomparably easier. Not until the atomic structure has been successfully represented in such a manner would I consider the quantum-riddle solved. Not, of course, in the way just described. Note on the Ghoice of Co-ordinates.-It has already been observed in 8, in connexion with equation (18a), that the choice of co-ordinates may with advantage be made so that - g = 1. Note on the Oharacter of the Space-time Oontinuum. Note that which quantity, by reason of (34) , is equal to i)!..(9...r;:.)
Note; Some of the statements in your paper con- cerning my life and person owe their origin to the lively imagination of the writer. Notes 1) Here we have assumed that there is nothing left over i.e. Notes 1) It follows that a natural object is associated also with a straight line. Notes 1) That is, a curve along which the body moves. Nothing disarms the recalcitrant so much as this. Nothing happens so long as the wire does not touch the zinc plate. Nothing is more needed to overcome the modernist's snob? Nothing more than that we might lay any number whatever of bodies of equal sizes side by side without ever filling space. Nothing of all that will remain but a few pitiful pages in the history books, briefly picturing to the youth of future generations the follies of its ancestors.
Nothing remained of all the properties of the ether except that for which it was invented, i.e., its ability to transmit electromagnetic waves. Nothing that has been said here about the two pictures of the motion has anything whatever to do with the relativity theory. Now I feel it my obligation to say something about the in? Now _ = - K (M/r), where K is Newton's constant of gravitation, and M is the mass of the heavenly body. Now according to the third axiom the system of equations for the transformed point {x' y' z i) involves the newly introduced magnitude {u p J C, e , m y E' , M') and their differential quotients with respect to {x , y' , *' , t') in the same manner as the original equations for the point {x, y, z^ t).
Now all these conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied for any conceivable material medium without certain very special and arbitrary assump- tions. Now any axis drawn consists of quickly vibrating molecules, and besides, takes part in all the journeys of the earth ; and therefore giyes us occasion for reflection. Now as regards the concept of space : this seems to presuppose the concept of tjie solid object. Now assuming that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations hold for a reference-body K, we then find that they do not hold for a reference-body K1 moving uniformly with respect to K, if we assume that the relations of the Galileian transformstion exist between the co-ordinates of K and K1.
Now at a point which is fixed with respect to the ether, the rate of change of electric polarisation is BD NOTES 167 Consider a slab of matter moving with velocity n, along- the .r-axis, then even in a stationary field of electrostatic polarisation, that is, for a field in which -^ =0, there will be some change in the polarisation of ot the body due to its motion, given by u r ^- . Now at the world-point Pj, 86 PHINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY the vector-potential of the field excited by e is represented by the vector in direction PQ., having the magnitude e cr i ; in its three space components along the x-j y-, c-axes ; the scalar-potential is represented by the component along the ^-axis.
Now before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always tacitly been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an absolute significance, i.e. Now came the second and no less arduous part of Kepler's life work. Now far the principle of the conservation of mass.
Now for different values of t\ the orbit of the space- point (,( y z) is an ellipse with the semi-major axis a and the eccentricity e. Let E denote the excentric anomaly, T APPENDIX 69 the increment of the proper time for a complete description of the orbit, finally nT =27r, so that from a properly chosen initial point t, we have the Kepler-equation (29) }iT=zE-e sin E. If we now change the unit of time, and denote the velocity of light by c, then from (28), we obtain Now neglecting c~* with regard to 1, it follows that 7/ ^ r 1 . Now for the reporter's version : "Mr. N. takes nothing very seriously and has a gift for making himself liked, particularly as he carefully cultivates a hearty and ingratiating manner.
Now for the reporter's version: "Mr. N takes nothing very seriously and has a gif t for making himself liked, particularly as he carefully cultivates a hearty and ingratiating maoner. Now from 4, and 6, it is to be seen that the equa- tions A), as well as the equations B) are covariant for a Lorentz-transformation, i.e. Now if Xy ijy Zy t are Iransformed to any set of new variables ji'j, ti'g, i'g, x^, we shall get a quadratic expression for ds^ =y J j.r J 2 H- 2-7j 2=^'i'''2 + = >'J i .i'V i ^Vj where the ^^s are functions of d'^, x^, .^'3, ii\ depending on the transforma- tion. Now if a space point A {'^'tiVof ^o) ^^ the time t be compared with a space point P ( f, ^, z) at the time fy and if the difference of time tt^, (let t > to) be less than the length A P i.e.
Now if hereafter, we succeed in maintaining this covariance as a definite connection between pure and simple observable phenomena in moving bodies, the definite con- nection may be styled ' the Principle of Relativity.' Now if instead of F, and / in the combinations (72) and (73), we introduce the electrical rest-force ^, the magnetic rest-force "^^ and the rest-ray O , we can pass over to the expressions, (82) L = ie$+^/x*^ (83) S,, = - I ^"$e,, - i/x*e,, -f {<^,, $/, ^4> (0/, <0j , + fi (*A 4^ * 4* <o, oj,) - Qk <^k e/x (Ok Qk (h. A- = 1, 2, 3, 4).
Now if instead of F, and / in the combinations (72) and (73), we introduce the electrical rest-force ^, the magnetic rest-force "^^ and the rest-ray O [(55), (56) and (57)], we can pass over to the expressions, (82) L = ie$+^/x*^ (83) S,, = - I ^"$e,, - i/x*e,, -f {<^,, $/, ^4> (0/, <0j , + fi (*A 4^ * 4* <o, oj,) - Qk <^k e/x (Ok Qk (h. A- = 1, 2, 3, 4). Now if the actual velocities of the stars, which can, of course, be measured, were smaller than the calculated velocities, we should have a proof that the actual attractions at great distances are smaller than by Newton's law.
Now if the actual velocities of the stars, which can, of course, be measured, were smaller than the calculated velocities, we should have a proof that the actual attractions at great distances are smaller than by Newtons law. Now if we call this force simply Othe force acting upon the electron,O8 and maintain the equationNmass ? Now if we make use of (59), and denote the space- vector which has O^, O3, O3 as the c, j/, z components bj the symbol W, then the third component of 92) can be expressed in the form ^93) ^^-^ (W^IL) The round bracket denoting the scalar product of the vectors within it. Now if we stick to our original coordinates, then the extension of the second electron is given by the cross section QQ of the strip belonging to it measured parallel to the '-axis.
Now if we use a system of co-ordinates which is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system, every fixed star describes a circle of immense radius in the course of an astronomical day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the law of inertia. Now if ~ be comparable to T, then it is impossible that the observations should satisfy Kepler^s Law. Now in mechanics the motion of materiai points is deter? Now in practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only with velocities that are small compared with the velocity of light; hence we shall hardly be able to compare the results of the previous section directly with the reality.
Now in reality (considered with reference to the railway embankment) he is hastening towards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of light coming from A. Now in regions where only electrical and gravitational fields are present, tbe right-hand side of this equation vanishes. Now in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun, our earth is comparable with a railway carriage travelling with a velocity of about 30 kilometres per second.
Now it came to me: the fact of the equality of inert and heavy mass, i.e., the fact of the independence of the gravitational acceleration of the nature of the falling substance, may be expressed as follows: in a gravi- tational field (of small spatial exten- sion) things behave as they do in a space free of gravitation, if one in- troduces in it, in place of an "inertial system,'* a reference system which is accelerated relative to an inertial sys- tem. Now it has long been known that the last question is not only unanswerable by the methods of geometry, but that it is in itself entirely without meaning. Now it is be noticed that the equation (57a) is ah'eady contained in (53), so that the latter only represents (7) independent equations. Now it is clear since a'Q' = ^OC', that QQ = /-OD'.
Now it is however clear that every co-variant four-vector is representable in the form of S If for example. Now it is known that due to motion alone there h a change in a vector It given by I ) ^^"^ ^^ motion //, div H -(-eurl TT^w] where u is the vector velocity of the moving- body and the vector product of II and //. Now it is known that there are certain well-tested theorems about the ponderomotive force in electromagnetic fields, where the group G^ is undoubtedly permissible. Now it is not dificult to understand why the generai prin? Now it is quite apparent that the system of values X^Oi^, f'2=<^25 aJ3=W3J '^'4=W4 < is transformed into the values a in virtue of the Lorentz-transformation (10), (11), (12).
Now it is rather confusing to find that in one branch of Physics, we shall find a covariance of the laws for the transformation of expression (1) with a finite value of 6', in another part for c= oo. Now it moves uniformly, sliding along the rod representing the c.s. Now let fa, fa, ... be the momenta transmitted to the molecule due to a number of mutually independent causes, so that the total momentum transfer A is given by A = S fa. Now let the co-ordinate plane ? Now let the cylinder rotate in the direction of the arrow P. The result is that the current of wind as it goes past the cylinder is divided unequally between the two sides: for the motion of the wind will be aided by the rotation of the cylin- der at B, and hindered at A.
Now let us conceive of the space-time lines inside a space-time dcliel as material curves composed of material points, and let us suppose that they are subjected to a continual change of length inside the sichel in the follow- ing manner. Now let us find out r as a function of (%,y,z,t). Now let us gradually change the position of one of the crystals by rotating it. Now let us have another look at those who have found favor with the angel. Now let us imagine that at the point N of the spherical surface, diametrically opposite to S, there is a luminous point, throwing a shadow L' of the disc L upon the plane E. Every point on the sphere has its shadow on the plane.
Now let us imagine that at the point N of the spherical surface,diametrically opposite to S, there is a luminous point, throwing a shadow L' of the disc L upon the plane E. Every point on the sphere has its shadow on the plane. Now let us imagine that each of the bodies has been surveyed by means of measuring instruments at rest relatively to itself, and let the surface of 81 prove to be a sphere, and that of 82 an ellipsoid of re volution. Now let us increase c to infinity. Now let us refer this domain to a random Gauss coordinate system or to a "mollusc" as reference-body K1. Now let us suppose that our railway carriage is again travelling along the railway lines with the velocity v, and that its direction is the same as that of the ray of light, but its velocity of course much less.
Now let us think that the surfaces of both the bodies (S^ and S.J are measured with the help of measuring rods (relatively at rest) ; it is then found that the surface of S^ is a sphere and the surface of the other is an ellipsoid of rotation. Now many authors say that clas^jieal mechanics stand in opposition to the relativity postulate, which is taken to be the basii of the new Electro-dyiiamics. Now many will say that fundamental agreement with Russia is impossible under the present circumstances. Now odxdx dx dx1 2 3 4 is an invariant, as is, therefore, also o?0dxdx dxdx1 2 3 4 . Now one important and courageous step more is needed to relate the mechanical and heat aspects of motion. Now rubbing is something which influences the wood and changes its properties.
Now since axiomatic geometry by itself contains no assertions as to the reality which can be experienced, but can do so only in combination with physical laws, it should be possible and reasonable whatever may be the nature of reality to retain Euclidean geometry. Now since axiomatic geometry by itself contains no assertions as to the reality which can be experienced, but can do so only in combination with physical laws, it should be possible and reasonablewhatever may be the nature of realityto retain Euclidean geometry. Now still a, little time remains for us to consider different paths leading to the establishment of a federation of nations in which men may develop and use their creative capacities to serve mankind.
Now suppose that the direction of the blow is not, as in the example of the cart, in the line of motion, but in a quite different direction, say, perpen- dicular to that line. Now suppose that the speed of light depends on the velocity of the emitting body. Now that the State has been weakened as a result of nonpolitical causes, it is up to the economically stronger members of the community to come to the rescue directly, and prevent the decay of scientific life. Now that the earth's orbit had been empirically determined, the true position and length of the line SE at any moment was known, and it was not so terribly difficult for Kepler to calculate the orbits and motions of the rest of the planets too from observa- tions at least in principle.
Now the Earth is a material object, which moves in different directions over the course of a year relative to the solar system. Now the contents ^?J of the normal cross-section of the filament which is laid through ( r, ?/, r, f) is vl ?t2 dr and the function v= ^ =/x a^i _ 2 =/x -^ . Now the coordinates, by themselves, no longer express metric relations, but only the "neighborliness " of athe things described, whose coordinates differ but little from one an? Now the earth at- tracts a stone with the force of gravity and knows nothing about its inertial mass. Now the fact that two things are said to be one and the same thing, if they coincide in all qualities, forces one to consider the geometrical relations between things as belonging to their qualities.
Now the linear element of the required four-dimensional space-time universe is also given us. Now the motion is represented as something which is, which exists in the two-dimensional time-space continuum, and not as something which changes in the one-dimensional space continuum. Now the principle of relativity requires that if the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space hold good in system K, they also hold good in system k; that is to say that the vectors of the electric and the magnetic forceN(X0, Y0, Z0) and (L0, M0, N0)Nof the moving system k, which are defined by their ponderomotive effects on electric or magnetic masses respectively, satisfy the following equations:N 1 X0 c ?
Now the right-hand side of (25) multiplied by ..y, "J2cf> "Jcp -.Jr iJX iJXv - {.v, T}-./riJX , 11 is a tensor. Now there is, as can be easily seen, a certain hyperbola, which has three infinitely contiguous points in common with the world-line at P, and of which the asymptotes are the generators of a 'fore-cone^ and an 'aft-cone.' Now this is the place where the reader's imagination boggles. Now this is the place where the readers imagination boggles. Now those who realize the immorality of war should do their utmost to disentangle themselves from this old idea of military duty and so become liberated from slavery. Now to tbe salaries of teachers.
Now to the origin of one of the two systems (k) let a constant velocity v be imparted in the direction of the increasing x of the other stationary system (K), and let this velocity be communicated to the axes of the co-ordinates, the relevant measuring-rod, and the clocks. Now we apply the law of conservation of momentum with respect to the z direction to our system in the coordinate? Now we are approaching the essential point showing where the classical transformation contradicts the theory of relativity. Now we can always choose v in such a way that Wv is greater than c-, since Wv is >c'- if {ix \- X)c jjlX is >0. Now we can have a full idea of the trans- formations which we picture to ourselves from a particular \ APPENDTJC 73 transformation in which (y, z) remain unaltered.
Now we can return to our subject. Now we can reverse the relation and say that an increase of E in the amount of energy must be accompanied by an in we bave in mind. Now we have just the opposite state of affairs for electrons. Now we have the atomic secret, we must not lose it, and that is what we should risk doing, if we give it to the United Nations Organization or to the Soviet Union. Now we have to deal with ponderomotive reactions and enero^v in the electro-maa;netic field. Now we might easily suppose that the existence of a gravitational field is always only an apparent one. Now we might think that as a consequence of this, the special theory of relativity and with it the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the dust.
Now we must bear carefully in mind that a mathematical description of this kind has no physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by time. Now we must first remark that the difierentiation between sense impressions and representations is not possible; or, at least it is not possible with absolute certainty. Now we must go one step farther. Now we put the question, What are the laws of disposition of the disc-shadows L' on the plane E? Now we remark that from the first point of view of ap- proximation the magnitudes r;.are ali small magnitudes of at least the first order. Now we see that, according to the first view of approxi- mation^ the magnitudes f 's are all small quantities of at least the first order.
Now we separate the metal into two parts and afterwards remove the rod. Now we take an example of a two-dimensional continuum which is finite, but unbounded. Now what are the feelings and needs that have led men to religious thought and belief in the widest sense of the words? Now what have the demands of orthogonality in space to do with this perfect freedom of the time-axis towards the upper half ?
Now without recognizing any hypothesis about the con- nection between " Ather " and matter, we can expect these mathematically evident theorems to have their consequences so far extended'that thereby even those laws of ponder- able media which are yet unknown may anj^how possess this covariance when subjected to a Lorentz-transformation ; by saying this, we do not indeed express an opinion, but rather a conviction,and this conviction I may be permit- ted to call the Postulate of Relativity. Now you perceive, why I said in the beginning AtPE^BlX 76 that time and space shall reduce to mere shadows and we shall have a world complete in itself.
Now, as judged from the disc, the latter is in a gravititional field of potential _, hence the result we have obtained will hold quite generally for gravitational fields. Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, neverthe? Now, even tl10ugh tl1e realms of relgion and science in them? Now, however, as we know how to judge whether two, or more, clocks show the same time simultaneously and run in the same way, we can very well imagine as many clocks as we like in a given c.s. Now, however, there are good grounds for hoping that the ice will soon be broken, thanks to the tact?
Now, however, there are good grounds for hoping that the ice will soon be broken, thanks to the tactful efforts of Lorentz, prompted by pure enthusiasm for the good cause. Now, if the acting forces are of such a kind as to guar? Now, if the movements of single particles are independent of one another to a sufficient degree of approximation, if the liquid is homo- geneous and exerts no force on the particles, then for equal size of domains the probability of each of the two systems will be equal, so that the follow- ing holds : dB dB' B B ' But from this and the last equation obtained it follows that J = J'. Now, it may happen that the two wave func- tions, )th and e, are eigenfunctions of two non- commuting operators corresponding to some physical quantities P and Q, respectively.
Now, secondly, let the velocity of the electron at a given epoch be v. We seek the law of motion of the electron in the immediately ensuing instants of time. Now, we cannot actually weigh the atoms individually. Now, we quickly change the position of the magnet either by removing it or by bringing it nearer the solenoid, whichever we prefer. Now, while in classica!mechanics, such additions can produce only correspondingly small alter system is first in the condition iv1 of lowest energy U1. Nowadays we are faced witb tbe dismaying fact that the poli? Nowadays we are faced with the curious fact that the politicians, the practical men of affairs, have become the exponents of international ideas. Nowadays, millions of people demonstrate that electromagnetic waves are sent and received.
Numerous and large are the lecture halls, but ON ACADEMIC F,REEDOM 29 far from numerous the young people who genuinely thirst for truth and justice. Numerous are the academic chairs, but rare are wise and noble teachers. Numerous are the wares that nature produces by the dozen, but her choice products are few. O that the nations might see, before it is too late, how much of their self-determination they have got to sacrifice in order to avoid the struggle of all against all!

ON THE IRREGULAR MOVEMENT OF PARTICLES SUSPENDED IN A LIQUID AND THE RELATION OF THIS TO DIFFUSION We will turn now to a closer consideration of the irregular movements which arise from thermal molecular movement, and give rise to the diffusion investigated in the last paragraph. ON THE METHOD OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS If you want to find out anything from the theoretical physicists about the methods they use, I advise you to stick closely to one principle : dont listen to their words, fix your attention on their deeds. ON THE METHOD OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS.
ON THE OSMOTIC PRESSURE TO BE ASCRIBED TO THE SUSPENDED PARTICLES Let z gram-molecules of a non-electrolyte be dissolved in a volume V* forming part of a quantity of liquid of total volume V. If the volume V* is separated from the pure solvent by a partition permeable for the solvent but impermeable for the solute, a so-called osmotic pressure, 9, is exerted on this partition, which satisfies the equation $V*= RTz . ON THE RELATIVITY OF LENGTHS AND TIMES. ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY It is a particular pleasure to me to have the privilege of speaking in the capital of the country, from which the most important fundamental notions of theoretical physics have issued. ONE had to understand clearly what the spatial coordinates and the temporal duration of events meant in physics.
ONE reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of all other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts. OPEN LETTER TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS. OUT OF MY LATER YEARS 1. aware that life is an adventure, that life must, forever, be. OUT OF MY LATER YEARS SELF-PORTRAIT. OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE LIFT The law of inertia marks the first great advance in physics; in fact, its real beginning. Obituary of the Surgeon, M. Katzenstein During the eighteen years I spent in Berlin I had few close friends, and the closest was Professor Katzenstein.
Objective knowledge provides us with powerful instruments for the achievements of certain ends, but the ultimate goal itself and the longing to reach it must come from another source. Objective knowledge provides us with powerful instruments for the achievernents of certain ends, but the ultimate goal itself and the longing to reach it must come from another source. Objectively, how- ever, my enterprise can be justified on the ground that it may, after all, be of interest to know how one who has spent a life-time in striving with all his might to clear up and rectify its fundamentals looks upon his own branch of science. Objects of everyday use are more solid than in Europe, houses infinitely more convenient in arrangement.
Observation of the motion of these double stars reveals the validity of Newton's gravitational law. Observation shows, indirectly, through the phenomena of electromagnetic field, that a moving clock changes its rhythm, a rod its length, whereas on the basis of mechanical phenomena we did not think this happened. Observations on the Present Situation in Europe The distinguishing feature of the present political situation of the world, and in particular of Europe, seems to me to be this, that political. Observations on the Special Theory of Relativity. Observers in the lift are performing experiments during the fall.
Observers moving with the moving rod would thus find that the two clocks were not synchronous, while observers in the stationary system would declare the clocks to be synchronous. Observers who take the railway train as their reference-body must therefore come to the conclusion that the lightning flash B took place earlier than the lightning flash A. Obviously it is immaterial whether the axes of K1 be chosen so that they are spatially parallel to those of K. It is also not essential that the velocity of translation of K1 with respect to K should be in the direction of the x-axis. Obviously its speed is increased. Obviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following manner.
Obviously the :6.rst draft would not be the final one, but the Russians should be made to feel that the world government will assure them their security. Obviously this will be the case when the relation (x' - ct') = _ (x - ct) . Obviously, for all s one has (3). Obviously, we should be fortunate if light waves were longitudinal. Occurrences in this domain are beyond the reach of exact prediction because of the variety of factors in operation, not because of any lack of order in nature. Occurrences in tliis domain are beyond t11e reach of exact prediction because of the variety of factors in operation, not because of any Iack of arder in nature.

Of Wealth I am absolutely convinced that no wealth in the world can help humanity forward, even in the hands of the most devoted worker in this cause. Of cause this is not surprising, since the equations of the Lorentz transformation were derived conformably to this point of view. Of course I do not in the least insist on this particular proposal. Of course he will be puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this gravitational field. Of course his view of the past and present history of his subject is likely to be unduly influenced by what he expects from the future and what he is trying to realize to-day. Of course it would be a great advance if we could succeed in comprehending the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field together as one unified conformation.
Of course the conviction of the "truth" of geometrical propositions in this sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete experience. Of course there will be opposition. Of course this feature of the velocity c as a limiting velocity also clearly follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for these became meaningless if we choose values of v greater than c. If, on the contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in the x-axis with respect to K, then we should have found that the length of the rod as judged from K1 would have been ; this is quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which forms the basis of our considerations.
Of course we must refer the process of the propagation of light (and indeed every other process) to a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate system). Of course we purchase our emancipation from the fundamental difficulties mentioned, at the cost of a modification and complication of Newton's law which has neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. Of course, it need not be emphasized that such a picture is worthless unless it leads to an exact theory. Of course, there is no such thing as a pure capitalist society in this sense. Of course, these ideologica!differences are a contributing element in an already serious tension. Of course, this generai requirement is much too vague that we should be able to draw from it with confidence specific rules to guide the individuals in their actions.
Of course, this kind of education counteracts all endeavorsa to establish moral authority for any supra? Of course, und erstand ing of our fellow-beings is impor? Of course, you must not take the comparison with the globe literally. Of one thing I feel certain: this same technical progress which, in itself, might relieve mankind of a great part of the labor necessary to its subsistence, is the main cause of our present 90 ON POLITICS, GOVERNMENT, AND PACIFISM rn.isery. Of one thing I feel certain: this same technical progress which, in itself, might relieve mankind of a great part of the labour necessary to its subsistence, is the main cause of our present troubles. Of that I am strongly convinced. Of the experimental reasons which warrant this assumption I will mention only one.
Of the sixteen components A"'", tbe four components A"'"' vanish ; the rest are equal and of opposite sign in pairs, so that tbere are only six components numerica lly d ifferent (a six-vector). Of these, let ?n possess energy values between E and E + ?E. Of two considerations that I have carried out, I wish to sketch one for you, which seems especially convincing to me because it can be imagined so clearly. Often a leader or despot, or a privileged class whose power is maintained in other ways, will combine the function of the priesthood with its own temporal rule for the sake of great security; or an alliance may exist between the interests of the political power and the priestly caste. Oh the Condancy of the Velocity of Light.
On Fresnel's fixed ether hypothesis, the incident light waves are situated in the stationary ethei outside the prism and move with veloeit)' c with respeci to the ether. On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies BY A. EjNSTEIJf. On a distant wall the hole in the screen will be represented as light on a dark back- ground. On a plane surface we may lay squares of cardboard so that each side of any square has the side of another square adjacent to it. On account of (68a) a = KM 47T ' . On account of its adaptability to the stationary system, we call the time defined in this way as " time of the stationary system. On account of their skewsymmetrical character there are not nine, but only three independent equations of this system.
On account of this fact, the coordinate space acquired an independent physical property which is not contained in the purely geometrica!notion of space, a circumstance which gave Newton considerable food for thought (pail-experiment ).2 Classica!mechanics is only a genera!scheme; it becomes a theory only by explicit indication of the force laws ( d ) as was done so very successfully by Newton for celestial me? On account of this transformation, the a? On aeeount of (30) the equation (66) becomes equivalent V to (57) and (57a) when K vanishes. On an Additional Term for the Field Equations of Gravitation. On contracting (38) with respect to the indices f1 a.nd u (inner multiplication by o), we obtain the vector A.. = Aafl + {/3ry, /3}A"Y + {/3ry, a}AYfl.
On grounds of symmetry it is clear that a circle round the origin in the -XY plane of K, can also be looked upon as a circle in the plane (X', Y') of K'. On integrating, one obtains from (19) hv I do\ - -^ [Q - &> ^-J &B? On many physicists and astronomers this argument makes no impression. On outer multiplication of the first by Bv, and of the second by A", we obtain in each case a tensor of the third rank. On physical grounds this gave rise to the conviction that the metrical field was at the same time the gravitational field. On tbe otber band, in antitbesis to my own most recent treatment of the subject, tbere is to be complete liberty in tbe cboice of the system of co-ordinates.
On the Cosmological Question The last result alread y permits the surmise that with our new formulation the universe may be regarded as spatially finite, withou t any necessity for an additional hypothesis.

On the Relativity of the Conception of Distance Let us consider two particular points on the train 1) travelling along the embankment with the velocity v, and inquire as to their distance apart. On the aft-side of O e have the already considered hyperboloidal shell F= c^^ -x^- -y- z" = '[, t>0. On the average every particle carries the same energy and both vessels have the same volume. On the basis of the description of a particle without singularity one has the possibility of a logically more satisfactory treatment of the combined problem: The problem of the field and that of motion coincide.
On the basis of the general theory of relativity, it is found that the ellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in the manner indicated above ; that for all the planets, with the exception of Mercury, this rotation is too small to be detected with the delicacy of observation possible at the present time ; but that in the case of Mercury it must amount to 43 seconds of arc per century, a result which is strictly in agreement with observation. On the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has been indicated, we are also in a position to establish the distance between two points on a rigid body by means of measurements.
On the basis of this hypothesis, the light-quanta hypothesis, the questions raised above about the emission and absorption of light can be answered. On the basis of this illustration, we are able to see the manner in which a refinement of the conception of position has been developed. On the basis of this simple remark, it can be seen that the proposed law of attraction in combination with new mechanics is not less suited for the explanation of astronomical phenomena than the Newtonian law of attraction in combination with Newtonian mechanics. On the basis of this theory there was obtained a surpris? On the contrary I felt sure that they could not do justice to experience.
On the contrary the scientists of those times were for the most part convinced that the basic concepts and laws of physics were not in a logical sense free inventions of the human mind, but rather that they were derivable by abstraction, i.e. On the contrary, a serious concern for the generai peace problem should be aroused. On the contrary, still other conclusions can be drawn. On the contrary, the aim must be the training of independently acting and thinking individuals, who, however, see in the service of the community their highest life problem. On the contrary, the aim must be the training of independently actng and thinking indi?
On the contrary, the following definition holds good : a co-ordinate system that is moved uniformly and in a straight line relatively to an inertial system is likewise an inertial system. On the contrary, the results of calculation indicate that if matter be distributed uniformly, the universe would necessarily be spherical (or elliptical). On the contrary, there is nothing to prevent our framing a general theory which takes account of the fact that in experiments carried out on the earth we are wholly unconscious of the translatory motion of the earth. On the contrary, they are contradicted by all observations made with the intention of proving them.
On the contrary, we arrived at the result that according to this latter theory the velocity of light must always depend on the co-ordinates when a gravitational field is present. On the contrary, we must remember that the time co-ordinate is defined physically wholly differently from the space co-ordinates. On the contrary, we regain the old concepts as a limiting case when the velocities are small. On the first-mentioned, the economie side, the working class may serve us as a model: they have succeeded, at least to some extent, in protecting their economie interests.
On the ground of this demand for symmetry, the triplet consisting of the first three equations are to be constructed after the model of the fourth ; remembering this circumstance, we are justified in saying, " If the relativity-postulate be placed at the head of mechanics, then the whole set of laws of motion follows from the law of energy." On the nature of the Electromotive Force caused hy motion in a magnetic field. On the one hand is the mechanical side of the pro- blem, the changes of velocity and position in time. On the one hand, they show the direction of the force acting on a body brought into the neighbourhood of the sphere-sun.
On the one side the freedom of the individual and the security of society beckon to us, on the other slavery for the individual and the annihilation of our civilization threaten us. On the otber hand, we transform the equations supplied with the cosmological term as alreatly given GI' - i>..gl'V == - 1C('l1 tgl'T).
On the oth-n* hand, the idei of rig^id bodies has anv sense only in a system mechanics with the group G^,.. Now if we have an optics with G,, and on the other hand if there are rigid bodies, it is easy to see that a /^-direction can be defined by the two hyperboloidal shells common to the groups G^^, and G^, which has got the further consequence, that by means of suitable rigid instruments in the laboratory, we can perceive a change in natural phenomena, in case of different orienta- tions, with regard to the direction of progressive motion of the earth. On the other band, let tbe functions H = .p , as well as ,/ - g. HAMILTON'S PRINCIPLE. On the other hand a gravitational force is considered quite real.
On the other hand a part of space may very well be imagined without an electromagnetic field; thus in contrast with the gravitational field, the electromagnetic field seems to be only secondarily linked to the ether, the formal nature of the electromagnetic field being as yet in no way determined by that of gravitational ether. On the other hand a portion of space without an electro-magnetic field is perfectly conceivable, hence the electro-magnetic field, in contrast to the gravita- tional field, seems in a sense to be connected with the ether only in a secondary way, inasmuch as the formal nature of the electro-magnetic field is by no means determined by the gravitational ether.
On the other hand it gets nearer to the grand aim of all science, which is to cover the greatest possible number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest possible number of hypotheses or axioms. On the other hand it seems to me certain that we must give up the idea of a complete localization of the particles in a theoretical model. On the other hand one does not see a priori whether the theory contains the quantum phenomena. On the other hand one recognizes immediately that the entropy has to vanish at the absolute zero point of temperature. On the other hand we should not make the mistake of blaming capitalism for all existing socia!and politica!evils, and of assuming that the very establishment of socialism would be able to cure all the social and politica!
On the other hand, I have purposely treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a "step-motherly" fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest for the trees. On the other hand, I maintain that cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest incitement to scientific research. On the other hand, I want to oppose the idea that the school has to teach directly that special knowledge and those accom? On the other hand, I want to oppose the idea that the school has to teach directly that special knowledge and those accomplishments which one has to use later directly in life.
On the other hand, Rontgen found in 1888 the magnetic effect due to a rotating dielectric (the condenser remain- ing stationary) to be proportional to K 1, and not to K. Finally Eichenwald in 1903 found that when both condenser and dielectric are rotated together, the effect observed was quite independent of K, a result quite consistent with the two previous experiments. On the other hand, all coordinate systems K1 moving relatively to K were to be regarded as in motion with respect to the 34ther. On the other hand, an observer who is poised freely in space will interpret the condition of things thus : " The rope must perforce take part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it transmits this motion to the body attached to it.
On the other hand, by multiplying the alternating matrices of _/^ and P^, we obtain (77) Y*f*= Sj ^ L, S 84.^ S 1 2 -s, '^912 ^1 >^ 3 2 2 R ^33 L, S 34 4. On the other hand, from the theoretical point of view this theory is not wholly satisfactory, because the principle of relativity just formulated prefers uniform motion. On the other hand, from the vanishing of s2 = x?2 = x12 + x22 + x32 + t2 it cannot be concluded that the two space-time points fall together; the vanishing of this quantity s2, is the invariant condition that the two space-time points can be connected by a light signal in vacuo.
On the other hand, from the very beginning there has always been present the attempt to find a unifying theoretical basis for all these single sciences, consisting of a minimum of concepts and fundamental relationships, from which all the concepts and relationships of the single disciplines might be derived by logical process. On the other hand, from time immemorial it has been known that heat could be produced by friction, as in the fre-making drills of the Indians. On the other hand, had the prediction of this movement proved to be in- correct, a weighty argument would be provided against the molecular-kinetic conception of heat.
On the other hand, if 8 is the coordinate of the first particle, it has for eigenfunctions corresponding to the eigenvalue x, where ()(xqx) is the well-known Dirac delta-function. On the other hand, if the cause of the displacement of spectral lines be definitely traced to the gravitational potential, then the study of this displacement will furnish us with important information as to the mass of the heavenly bodies.
On the other hand, if we conceive the second electron to be at rest, and therefore adopt the system (.0', i\) then the cross-section PT' of the strip of the electron parallel to OC is to be regarded as its length and we shall find the first electron shortened with reference to the second in the same propor- tion, for it is, P'P' _0D _0p'_ QQ (ra'~oc'~oc - pp Lorentz called the combination /-' of {t and ,* ) as the local ti'tie {Ortszeit) of the uniformly moving electron, and used a physical construction of this idea for a better compre- hension of the contraction-hypothesis. On the other hand, if we missed an important word which will never be repeated, we must run with a speed greater than that of sound to reach the pro- duced wave and to catch the word.
On the other hand, if we transform to a set of rotating axes, we must introduce a centrifugal force in order to correct for the change of axes. On the other hand, in other countries where military service is not compulsory, these same pacifists should openly assert that in case of war, they them selves would not participate. On the other hand, it makes no attempt to give a mathematical representation of what is actually present or goes on in space and time. On the other hand, it seems to me certain that we have to give up the notion of an absolute localization of the particles in a theoretical model. On the other hand, one who has come to this country as a mature person may have a keen eye for everything peculiar and characteristic.
On the other hand, only two independent terms appear in equation (32). On the other hand, owing to the smallness of as compared with I, we can replace (B) in the first place by , or to the same order of approximation by , which agrees with Fizeau's result. On the other hand, representatives of science have often made an attempt to arrive at fundamental judgments with respect to values and ends on the basis of scientfic met11od, and in this way have set themselves in opposition to relgion. On the other hand, representatives of science have often made an attempt to arrive at fundamental judgments with respect to values and ends on the basis of scientific method, and in this way bave set themselves in opposition to religion.
On the other hand, since at the time of measurement the two systems no longer interact, no real change can take place in the second system in consequence of anything that may be done to the first system. On the other hand, space as a whole, as con- ceived by Descartes, was absolutely necessary to New- tonian physics. On the other hand, suppose that we have two insulated con- ductors having equal but opposite charges, one positive and the other negative. On the other hand, technology-or applied science-has confronted mankind with problems of profound gravity. On the other hand, the Maxwell-Lorentz equations have proved their validity in the treatment of optical problems in moving bodies.
On the other hand, the density of the lines of force in space shows how the force varies with the distance. On the other hand, the form corresponding to the relativity principle, for the condition of non-magnetisation is to be taken out of (D) in 8, with />i= ], not as B = H, as Lorentz takes, but as (30) B = H (M \_uYj']=iii . On the other hand, the form corresponding to the relativity principle, for the condition of non-magnetisation is to be taken out of (D) in 8, with />i= ], not as B = H, as Lorentz takes, but as (30) B = H (M \_uYj']=iii [ne'\ Now by putting H = B, the differ- ential e(piation (:29) is transformed into the same form as eq" (1) here when /// =M \^u1l'].
On the other hand, the formation of large organizations with a large membership can of itself bring us very little nearer to our goal. On the other hand, the idealized experiments about the falling lift show clearly that there is no chance of formulating general relativity without solving the problem of gravitation. On the other hand, the measaring-rod will not experience a shortening in length, as judged from K, if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the radius. On the other hand, the negative evidences in favour of the convection-coefficient had also multiplied.
On the other hand, the problem of devising the mechanical model of ether seemed to become less and less interesting and the result, in view of the forced and artificial character of the assumptions, more and more discouraging. On the other hand, the relation found can be used for the determination of N. We obtain I RT ha2 3wkP' N = - * - It is to be hoped that some enquirer may succeed shortly in solving the problem suggested here, which is so important in cqnnection with the theory of Heat. On the other hand, there is an important argument in favor of the hypothesis of the ether.
On the other hand, these concepts and relations, and indeed the setting of real objects and, generally speaking, the existence of "the real world," have justification only in so far as they are connected with sense impressions between which they form a mental connection. On the other hand, these concepts and relations, and is not possible with absolute certainty. On the other hand, this concept are necessities. On the other hand, up to the present time, the field theory is unable to give an explanation of the molecular structure of matter and of quantum phenomena. On the other hand, we deduce from the restricted theory the existence of a Riemannian metric within the time-space continuum, which, according to the equiva?
On the other hand, what I value in our political system is the more extensive provision that it makes for the individual in case of illness or need. On the other hand, with every set of value of ^14^ ^24J ^34' ^44 w^iich in this way fulfil the condition 22) with real values of ^^, Vy, v,, we can construct the special Lorentz transformation (L6) with (^1 4, ^245 ^3 4> ^^44) as the last vertical column,and then every Lorentz- transformation with the same last vertical column (^14^ <^2 4? On the other handling for r = 2m becomes infinite and hence we have there R singularity. On the other there is friction and therefore the creation of heat, on the rail and in the wheels.
On the possibility alone of such a correspondencerests the value and the justification of the whole system, and especially of its fundamentalconcepts and basic laws. On the right-hand side of (9) stand those terms which, from the phenomenological point of view, are to be replaced by the energy-tensor of matter ; that is, they are to be replaced by o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o p where p denotes the mean density of rnatter assumed to be at rest. On the spherical surface the construction also seems to promise success at the outset, and the smaller the radius of the disc in proportion to that of the sphere, the more promising it seems. On the stage of our subconscious mind appear in colorful succession sense experiences, memory pictures of them, repre?
On the strength of the foundation here briefly sketched Newton succeeded in explaining the mo- tions of the planets, moons and comets down to the smallest details, as well as the tides and the preces- sional movement of the earth ^a deductive achieve- ment of unique magnificence. On the whole, this gold cannot be utilized except for the purchase of foreign com?
On the.other hand, if small suspended particles are present in the fractional volume V* in place of the dissolved substance, which particles are also unable to pass through the partition permeable to the solvent : according to the classical theory of MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES 3 thermodynamics-at least when the foree of gravity (which does not interest us here) is ignored-we would not expect to find any force acting on the partition ; for according to ordinary conceptions the free energy of the system appears to be independent of the position of the partition and of the suspended particles, but dependent only on the total mass and qualities of the suspended material, the liquid and the partition, and on the pressure and temperature.
On their spherical surface our flat beings would find for this ratio the value i.e. On this basis the German nation has brought forth fruits of culture which form an integral part of the development of the modern world. On this basis, who would have enough imagination to construct an oscillatory theory of light? On this hypothesis we base the following considerations. On this interpretation, the Lorentz- Fitzgerald contrac- tion and "local time" lose their arbitrary character. On this point of' view, since either one or the other, but not both simultaneously, of the quantities I' and Q can be predicted, they are not simultane- ously real. On this point one must agree un? On this point one must agree unre?
On this point the quantum theory of to-day differs fundamentally from all previous theories of physics, mechanistic as well as field theories. On this point we axe enlightened by a most important experiment which the brilliant physicist Fizeau performed more than half a century ago, and which has been repeated since then by some of the best experimental physicists, so that there can be no doubt about its result. On this view the Fresnelian con- vection coefficient comes out to be i, as shown by J. J. Thomson in 1880, instead of 1 ^//x- as required by optical experiments.
On this view the whole of the polarised ether is carried away by the moving medium, and consequently, the convection co-efficient naturally becomes unity in this theory, a value quite as discrepant as that obtained on the original Maxwellian assumption. Once again using the field language, we can say: the faster the electric field changes, the stronger the ac- companying magnetic field. Once again we reach a conclusion which is confirmed by everyday experience : if the laws of mechanics are valid in one c.s., then they are valid in all c.s. Once again, new facts suggested by the field theory are confirmed by experiment !
Once formed and widely accepted, however, they very often influence the further development of scientific thought by indicating one of the many possible lines of pro- cedure. Once having chosen this way, we are obliged to go further toward abstraction. Once having gained the concept of heat, we can in- vestigate its nature more closely. Once having learned how to read the charac- ter of the magnetic forces from the field model of a current, we shall always draw the field surrounding the wire through which the current flows, in order to represent the action of the magnetic forces at any point in space.
Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, however, we can combine this with the principle of relativity, and sum up the theory thus: Every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is transformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the space-time variables x, y, z, t of the original coordinate system K, we introduce new space-time variables x1, y1, z1, t1 of a co-ordinate system K1. Once it was shown that sirnultaneity was relative and depended on the frame of reference, every possibility of retaining actions? Once more we are back at our initial question! Once more we realize the serious character of our difficulties. Once more, the example of the moving room with outside and inside observers will be used.
Once the concept of the solid object is formed in connection with the experiences just mentioned ^which concept by no means presupposes that of space or spatial rela- tion the desire to get an intellectual grasp of the relations of such solid bodies is bound to give rise to concepts which correspond to their spatial relations. Once the idea of inertia is understood, one wonders what more can be said about it. Once the machine is sufficiently highly developed it becomes cheaper in the end than the cheapest labour. Once the machine is sufliciently highly developed it becomes cheaper in the end than the cheapest labor. Once these goals exist, the scientific method furnishes means to reali7e tbem. Once these goals exist, the scientific method furnishes means to realize them.
Once this basis is accepted, the expression for the force of gravitation appears derivable from experi- ence, and it was reasonable to hope for the same in regard to other forces. Once this break was made, the line of further development was clear. Once this formulation is successfully accomplished, inference follows on inference, often revealing rela- tions which extend far beyond the province of the reality from which the principles were drawn. Once this important work was done, further pro- gress was rapid. Once this stage has been reached, the ability to understand the convictions and actions of the "unfaithful" vanishes completely. Once we have the courage to introduce this concept, everything else becomes clear and convincing.
Once we have understood that, we shall find the strength far the sacrifces necessary to ensure the future of mankind. Once, therefore, he has performed the first task in some department, or for some complex of related phenomena, he is certain of success, provided his industry and intelligence are adequate. One accepted its intrinsic qualities as a matter of course, as the air one breathed. One after the other, the electrons are sent in the direction of the pinholes. One became used to treating electric and magnetic fields as fundamental concepts that did not require a mechanical interpretation. One becomes sharply aware, but without regret, of the limits of mutua!
One can also ^with the aid of small floating bodies, say trace the progressive changes in the position of the in- dividual particles. One can conclude from the fact that 2 is proportional to A that the pressure variations for two neighboring regions are completely independent of each other, if the regions have dimensions large compared to the wavelength of the reflection frequency . One can further conclude that every absorption or release of energy brings with it an increase or decrease in the mass of the object under consideration. One can have the clearest and most complete knowledge of what is, and yet not be able to deduct from that what should be the goal of our human aspirations.
One can never see where a planet really is at any given moment, but only in what direction it can be seen just then from the earth, which is itself moving in an unknown manner around the sun. One can organize to apply a discovery already made, but not to make one. One can read the law of gravitation from such a drawing just as well as from a description of the action in words, or in the precise and econo- mical language of mathematics. One can see from the way he formulated his views that Newton felt by no means comfortable about the concept of absolute space, which embodied that of absolute rest; for he was alive to the fact that nothing in experience seemed to correspond to this latter concept.
One can trace the progres- sive changes which take place in the undulating sur- face where the water and the air meet. One clock is sufficient for the two c.s., for the time flow is the same for both. One clock was sufficient, but nobody could object to the use of many, so long as they behave as decent synchronized clocks should. One considers the system as being "at rest" and considers the "apparent" gravitational field which exists with respect to it as a "real" one. One could never get a clear picture of the interior forces governing the ether, nor of the forces acting between the ether and the "ponderable" matter. One could object to this conclusion on the grounds that our criterion of reality is not suf- ficiently restrictive. One could say that it has affected us quati?
One edge of the rainbow is always red and the other violet. One feels easily justified in this, because the smallness of the impulses transmitted by the radiation field implies that these can almost always be neglected in practice, when compared with other effects causing the motion. One has to keep this constantly in mind if one wishes to understand spiritual movements and their de? One has to keep this constantly in mind if one wishes to understand spiritual movements and their development.
One has to realize that the powerful industrial groups concerned in the manufacture of arms are doing their best in all countries to prevent the peaceful settlement of international disputes, and that rulers can achieve this great end only if they are sure of the vigorous support of the majority of their peoples. One hopes to win the favor of this being by deeds and sacrifices, which, ac cording to the tradition of the race, are supposed to appease the being or to make him well disposed to man. One is able to under- stand why no neutral particles of negative mass are to be found. One is led thereby to a general theory of gravitation which includes dynamics. One is of a general character, stating the connection between force and change in velocity.
One is ordinarily accustomed to study geometry divorced from any relation between its concepts and experience. One is sharply conscious, yet without regret, of the limits to the possibility of mutual understanding and sympathy with one's fellow-creatures. One is struck that the theory (except for the four-dimen- sional space) introduces two kinds of physical things, i.e., (1) measuring rods and clocks, (2) all other things, e.g., the electro-magnetic field, the material point, etc. One is the bending of light rays in a gravitational field. One is therefore led, according to this theory, to consider the electron or proton as a two-bridge problem. One is therefore operating with tensor densities of a suitable weight instead of with tensors.
One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete. One marked advantage of the Einstein transformation consists in the fact that the field equations of a moving system preserve exactly the same form as those of a stationary system. One may compare these rules with the rules of a game in which, while the rules themselves are arbitrary, it is their rigidity alone which makes the game possible. One may compare these rules with the rules of a game in which, while the rules will depend largely upon the chosen rep resentation.
One may however easily be led into the errar of believing that these notions, whose origin is forgotten, are necessary and unalterable accompaniments to our thinking, and this errar may constitute a serious danger to the progress of science. One may now ask: Does iv describe a real condition of the system? One may say "the eternai mystery of the world is its comprehensi? One may therefore say that the ether of the general theory of relativity is de- rived through relativization from the ether of Lor- entz. One might expect a similar effect for electronic waves with the same order of wave-length.
One might expect that processes in which several elementary particles take part correspond to regular solutions of the field equations with several bridges between the two equivalen t, sheets corresponding to the physical space. One might imagine a situation in which diffraction and interference were still unknown, but one knew that the average magnitude of the irregular variations of the radiation pressure was determined by the second term of the above equation, where is a parameter of unknown meaning that determines the color.
One misses the elementary reaction against injustice and for justice- that reaction which in the long run represents man's only protection against a MESSAGE FOR POSTERITY TIME IS RICH in inventive minds, the inventions of which could facilitate our lives considerably. One more consequence of the field description should be mentioned. One more observation to finish up with. One more observation, to finish. One more step should be taken. One morning a reporter comes to you and asks you in a friendly way to tell him something about your friend N. At first you no doubt feel something approaching indignation at such a proposal. One moroing a reporter comes to you and asks you in a friendly way to tell bim some?
One must also have a formal point of view which will sufficiently restrict the unlimited variety of possibilities. One must bear in mind that the people in Russia did not have a long politica !education, and changes to improve Russian conditions had to be carried through by a minority for the reason that there was no majority capable of doing it. One must draw the velocity vectors for two instants separated by a very short time interval and therefore corresponding to positions very near each other. One must net attempt to justify them, but rather to sense their nature simply and clearly. One must not attempt to justify them, but rather to sense their nature simply and clearly.

One need only tliink of the systematic arder in heredity, and in tlie 48 IDEAS AND OPINIONS effect of poisons, as for instance alcohol, on the behavior of organic beings. One need only tliink of the weatlier, in which case prediction even far a few days ahead is impossible.
One obtains the value L' = L / (1 - v2/c2) Since the conservation of energy principle must also hold in the new reference frame, one obtains analogously E' = e' / (1 - v2/c2)) Subtracting and ignoring fourth- and higher-order terms in v/c, we get E' - E = e' - e + (1/2) L (v2/c2) But E' - E is the object's kinetic energy before the light emission and e' - e is its kinetic energy after the light emission. One of its poles now points to the reader if the page of this book represents the plane of the circle. One of the imperfections of the original relativistic theory of gravitation was that as a field theory it was not complete; it introduced the independent postulate that the law of motion of a particle is given by the equation of the geodesic. '
One of the most fundamental questions has not been settled as yet: does an inertial system exist? One of the most fundamental questions raised by recent advance in science is how to reconcile the two contradictory views of matter and wave. One of the most important characteristics of modern physics is that the conclusions drawn from initial clues are not only qualitative but also quantitative. One of the most primitive concepts is that of an object. One of the observers takes a handkerchief and a watch from his pocket and drops them. One of the problems of pacifism is, that when pacifists come together, they usually have the feeling that they are consorting with the sheep while the wolves are out side. One of the simplest optical facts is that the propaga- tion of light is rectilinear.
One of the walls is trying to escape from and the opposite wall to approach the light signal. One of the walls runs away from the light and the other approaches it. One of tlie two fundamental Postulates of the Principle of Relatlvitv is that the velocity of lisfht should remain oonstant whether the source is moving or stationary. One ought to be ashamed to make use of the wonders of science embodied in a radio set, the while appreciating them as little as a cow appreciates the botanic marvels in the plants she munches. One outstanding peculiarity still attaches to the concept of electric forceit is not amenable to any process of being " transformed awav " bv a suitable change of framework. One possible method would be to use television.
One possible way Achieving this might be you to entrust a person with this task Who has your confidence, and who coule perhaps serve in an unofficial capacity. One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of all other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts. One remark about concepts in general, before we turn to the problem of space : concepts have reference to sensible experience, but they are never, in a logical sense, deducible from them. One remark, however, appears indispensable.
One requirement, however, must be rigorously satisfied: any generalized concept must reduce to the original one when the original con- ditions are fulfilled. One sees that a priori it is not at all necessary that the /'times" thus defined in different inertial systems agree with one another. One sees that in this paradox the germ of the special relativity theory is already contained. One sees that the slower molecules occur more frequently, as compared to the fast ones, than they would by virtue of MaxwellOs law. One segment will correspond to a foot and another to a second. One senses him 22 IDEAS AND OPINIONS in the reading of Russell's philosophical analyses, whose acu?
One senses him in the reading of Russell's philosophical analyses, whose acumen and simplicity of expression have often reminded me of Hume. One senses not only a threat to man's cultura! One sets up as field equation Ru. One significant step farther and we shall have the right clue. One spoke of points of space, as of instants of time, as if they were absolute realities. One therefore obtains F ' = J(Ai/cj*. One thing, however, seems certain: namely, that the generai principle of relativity will prove a necessary and effective tool for the solution of the problem of the total field. One way, though by no means the simplest, of not hearing what someone is saying, is to run, with a velocity greater than that of sound, rela- tive to the air surrounding the speaker.
One well-known fact should be mentioned, for later we shall make use of it. One who has grown up in an environment takes much far granted. One who prefers concrete pictures can safely think of a ship or a train moving relative to the earth. One will naturally cling to this simplest assumption as long as it is not controverted experiment. One will probably find but rarely, if at ali, the rationalistic standpoint expressed in such crass form; for any sensible man would see at once how one-sided is such a statement of the position. One will probably find but rarely, if at all, the rationalistic standpoint expressed in such crass form; for any sensible man would see at once how one-sided is such a statement of the position.
One would be inclined to answer this question in the negative in view of the fact that the Schwarzschild solution for the spherically symmetric static gravitational field and Reissner's extension of this solution to the case when an electrostatic field is also present each have a singularity. One would hardly suspect the existence of an important clue which no one noticed for three hundred years. One would have noticed this long ago, if, for the practical experience of everyday life light did not appear (because of the high value of c), as the means for the statement of absolute simul- taneity. One would have thought that an inventive brain might have hit upon this idea by itself, i.e., without an extraneous cause.
One's object now is to secure the favour of these beings by carrying out actions and offering sacrifices which, according to the tradition handed down from generation to generation, propitiate them or make them well disposed towards a mortal. Onlv when these two conditions have been fully met can we have some assurance that we shall not vanish into the atmosphere, dissolved into atoms, one of these days. Only a few had the moral greatness to resist; them I regard as the real heroes of the Great War. Only a few individuals are known to the masses as personalities, through their creative achievements.

Only an experiment can decide whether or not this statement is true.

Only by _mens of setting energetically about such a task can an orgamzation like the one here planned achieve inward strength and out? Only by investigations of these solutions will one be able to determine the extent to which the theory accounts for the facts. Only exceptionally gifted individuals or especially noble communities rise essentially above this level; in these there is found a third level of religious experience, even if it is seldom found in a pure form. Only from those who have had the chance in their early years to fortify their minds and broaden their outlook through study.
Only if exhaustive preparations of this kind are made for the Conference, if surprises are thereby ruled out, and an atmosphere of confidence is created by genuine good will, can we hope for a happy issue. Only if he reaches those heights can he contribute towards improving the lot of humanity. Only if outward and inner freedorn are constantly and consciously pursued is there a possibility of spiritual developrnent and perfection and thus of irnproving man's outward and inner life. Only if the statesmen have behind them the will to peace of a decisive majority in their own countries can they attain their great end, and for the formation of this public opinion each one of us is responsible in every word and deed.
Only if this sort of representation of the atomistic structure be obtained could I regard the quantum problem within the framework of a continuum theory as solved. Only if we succeed in abolishing compulsory service altogether will it be possible to educate the youth in the spirit of reconciliation, joy in life, and love towards all living creatures. Only in my later yeaTS was I able to appreciate fully this half-skeptical, half-humble attitude. Only in this sense can the question of the nature of a conceptually presented entity be reason- ably raised. Only in this way shall we be able to describe the electric and magnetic phenomena in accordance with the law of conservation of energy. Only in uniform, rectilinear mo- tion are there no forces involved.
Only individuals of exceptional endowments and exceptionally high-minded communities, as a general rule, get in any real sense beyond this level. Only one experiment seemed incompatible with Lorentz's theory, namely, the interference experiment of Michelson and Morley. Only one of the many quantitative results reached by experiment and theory will be mentioned here. Only one transformation from one c.s. Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures. Only other, nonlinear field equations could possibly accomplish such a thing. Only relative uniform motion can be observed.
Only slowly, under the irresistible pressure of facts, there developed a new foundation of physics, field-physics. Only so can the Jews regain social health. Only so could the era in theoretical physics inaugurated by Faraday and Clerk Maxwell be brought to a satis- factory close. Only something which did not in similar fashion seem to be "evident" appeared to me to be in need of any proof at all. Only statistical laws can be formulated, laws governing large aggregations of atoms. Only such equations as are covariant in relation to arbitrary transformations in this sense have meaning as ex?

Only the emission of definite energy quanta is permissible, all others being prohibited.

Only the existence of these varied, frequently conflicting, strivings accounts for the special character of a man, and their specific combination determines the extent to which an individual can achieve an inner equilibrium and can contribute to the well-being of society.
Only the genius of Riemann, solitary and uncomprehended, had already won its way by the middle of last cen- tury to a new conception of space, in which space was deprived of its rigidity, and in which its power to take part in physical events was recognized as pos- sible. Only the individuai can think, and thereby create new values for society, nay, even set up new moral standards to which the !ife of the co=unity conforms. Only the individual can think, and thereby create new values for society nay, even set up new moral standards to which the life of the community conforms. Only the leaves of the electroscope near the rubber rod will remain apart. Only then did it become possible to think about discovering the general laws which these movements satisfy.
Only then the attempt was made to clarify the issue by thorough argument. Only this fundamental change, brought into physics by the quantum theory, made possible an adequate 308 THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS explanation of the apparently discontinuous and statis- tical character of events in the realm of phenomena in which the elementary quanta of matter and radiation reveal their existence. Only this: the external influences have been made smaller. Only those points of the hyper-surf ace are of interest to us which bave metrica! Only those who have dedicated their lives to similar ends can have a living conception of the inspiration which gave these men the power to remain loyal to their purpose in spite of countless failures.

Only those who realize the immense efforts and, above all, the devotion which pioneer work in theoretical science demands, can grasp the strength of the emotion out of which alone such work, remote as it is from the immediate realities of life, can issue. Only through clear formulation and frank discussion of concrete proposals can men of good will in all countries help to achieve a solution. Only through perils and upheavals can Nations be brought to further developments.

Only to a tiny minority is it given to fascinate their generation by subtle humour and grace and to hold the mirror up to it by the impersonal agency of art. Only too often a contemptible and joyless egoism has resulted from such circumstances. Only we must be on our guard against ascribing a state of motion to the ether. Only we must take care not to ascribe a state of motion to the ether. Only when the continuum is a Euclidean one is it possible to associate the co-ordinates x1 . Only when they do convey something will geometry possess any real content for him.
Only when this goal has been completely reached will it be possible to talk about a pure field-theory. Only with clifficulty can one see what is really behind such a conven? Only with very great velocities can the validity of the Lorentz transformation be tested. Or does the ether resemble an elastic jelly, a medium in which only transverse waves can be set up and whose particles move in a direction per- pendicular to that in which the wave itself travels? Or has this apparently well-founded picture been changed in the light of newer developments? Or in brief : General laws of nature are co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations.
Or they could take the line that Newtons forces acting at a distance only appeared to act thus directly; that they were really transmitted by a medium which permeated space, either by motions or by an elastic deformation of this medium. Or, in other words : the earth attracts the stone. Or, in other words, classical mechanics cannot be valid if the velocities approach that of light. Or, in other words, the " jelly-like" character of the ether must be assumed. Or, in other words, the energies of the photons in the visible spectrum are always enclosed within the limits formed by the photon energies of the violet and red lights.
Or, in other words, we add a third principle: (3) Positions and velocities are transformed from one inertial system to another according to the classical transformation. Or, in other words, we must assume that many energy levels are allowed in an atom and that the emission of a photon corresponds to the transition of the atom from a higher energy level to a lower one. Or, to be more explicit, it does not matter whether a given body increases its velocity in one second from 100 to 101 feet per second, or from 100 miles to 100 miles and one foot per second or from 180,000 miles to 180,000 miles and one foot per second. Or, using our previous ter- minology, we could say that the oscillating string has its spectrum, just as an element emitting radiation.
Or: How large is the probability that at a randomly chosen instant of time all n movable points in the given volume v0 will be found by chance in the volume v? Order reigns in the magnet as a whole, for all the elementary dipoles are directed in the same way. Organization has to some extent taken the place of leading personalities, particularly in the technical sphere, but also to a very perceptible extent in the scientific. Organization has to some extent taken the place of the great man, particularly in the technical sphere, but also to a very perceptible extent in the scientific. Others, more profound and important, will be discussed later. Otherwise he-with his specialized knowledge-more closely resembles a well-trained dog than a harmoniously developed person.
Otherwise the constants BTM and B^ would have to depend on the direction, and this can be avoided by making the assumption of isotropy or pseudo-isotropy (using time-averages). Otherwise, the change of velocity would be different in each of the two c.s., the difference being brought in by the change of velocity of the relative motion of the two rods, representing our co-ordinate systems. Ought it not to be possible in this case to regard the co-ordinate system as stationary and the centrifugal forces as gravitational forces? Ought one to laugh, weep, or hope when one thinks of it? Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion ? Our Planck is one of them, and that is why we love him.
Our admiration for this splendid man is accom- panied by another feeling of admiration and rever- ence, the object of which is no man but the mysterious harmony of nature into which we are born. Our affection for him needs no threadbare explanation. Our aim has been to sketch, as briefly as possible, the de? Our aim here is to show how the ideas of substances, particles, and forces penetrated the field of optics, and how finally the old philosophical point of view broke down. Our aim is to indicate the ideas forming the basis of a new physical and philosophical view. Our aim is to learn, by experiment, all we can about the magnetic field associated with the current flowing through a solenoid and to incorporate this knowledge in the construction of a field.
Our aim was to introduce another theory of light, different from the corpuscular one, but also attempting to explain the same domain of facts. Our argument can be reversed: if the velocity of light is the same in all c.s., then moving rods must change their length, moving clocks must change their rhythm, and the laws governing these changes are rigorously determined. Our assumption that the special theory of relativity can always be applied to an infnitely small region, implies that ds2 can always be expressed in accordance with (1) by means of real quantities dX 1 dX4 If we denote by dT0 the " natural " element of volume dX 1, dX2 , dX3, dX4, then dT 0 = J dT . Our attempts to discover the properties of the ether led to difficulties and contradictions.
Our conclusion is based on Oersted's experiment, but it covers much more. Our conclusion is: if ether is carried with the room moving with its light source and if the mechanical laws are valid, then the velocity of light must depend on the velocity of the light source. Our course was more on the following Iines. Our discussion reveals a grave difficulty in classical physics. Our drawing shows a simple model of the structure of a crystal. Our drawing shows the closed circuit and the magnetic lines of force. Our entire know- ledge of the acting forces can be summarized in the construction of the field. Our everyday think ing is satisfied on the whole with this level. Our example was, of course, a very simple one, that of rectilinear motion in which the c.s.
Our experience hitherto justifies us in believing that nature is the realization of the simplest conceivable mathematical ideas. Our experience is far from being sufficient to enable us to answer this question. Our experiment then shows : by the motion of a magnetic dipole a new force was created, moving the electric fluid in the wire. Our fate will be according to our deserts. Our first example is the so-called solenoid. Our forefathers in those days were pretty poor specimens intellectually and physically, but socially speaking they enjoyed an enviable spiritual equilibrium.
Our friends are not exactly numerous, but among them are men of noble spirit and strong sense of justice, who have devoted their lives to uplifting human society and liberating the individual from degrading oppression. Our graphic picture of motion is a useful convention since it characterizes the position of the particle at an arbitrary instant. Our idealized experiment about destroying the mo- tion in order to find the velocity vector must not be taken too seriously. Our intention was rather to sketch in broad outline the attempts of the human mind to find a connection between the world of ideas and the world of phenomena.
Our interest here lies in the first stages of develop- ment, in following initial clues, in showing how new physical concepts are born in the painful struggle with old ideas. Our intuitive idea is that motion is connected with the acts of pushing, lifting or pulling. Our knowledge is now wider and more profound than that of the physicist of the nineteenth century, but so are our doubts and difficulties. Our last two drawings should be carefully compared. Our new assumptions are: (1) The velocity of light in vacuo is the same in all c.s. Our new con- clusion, based on the law of inertia, is : in general the action of an external force changes not only the speed but also the direction of the motion.
Our new gravitational equations are also structure laws describing the changes of the gravitational field. Our new idea is simple: to build a physics valid for all c.s. Our next drawing therefore represents not just a fragment as before, but a complete knowledge of the motion. Our next problem is to seek the field-equations of gravitation in the absence of matter. Our next task is to find the field equations of gravitation in the absence of matter. Our only way out seems to be to take for granted the fact that space has the physical property of trans- mitting electromagnetic waves, and not to bother too much about the meaning of this statement. Our physical space as conceived through objects and their motion has three dimensions, and positions are characterized by three numbers.
Our physicist works in a room without windows and has no com- munication whatever with the outside world. Our physicist would have to discard, with the law of inertia, all mechanical laws. Our picture of ether might very probably be something like the mechanical picture of a gas that explains the propagation of sound waves. Our previous difficulties are broadened and deep- ened by this result. Our principle rather asserts what follows : If we formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained from experience, by making use of (a) the embankment as reference-body, (b) the railway carriage as reference-body, then these general laws of nature (e.g. Our problem is of a different nature.
Our psychological experience con tains, in colorful succession, sense expe riences, memory pictures of them, im ages, and feelings. Our purpose is to furnish a striking example of the role of theory in physics. Our question is: how can we find, from the drawing, the direction of the force, at any point in space? Our question is: with what force does the current act upon a magnetic pole placed somewhere in its vicin- ity? Our result may also be stated as follows : According to the general theory of relativity, the major axis of the ellipse rotates round the sun in the same sense as the orbital motion of the planet. Our results concerning the equation of state are containd in the following equations: (18) (cf (16a)) (19) (cf (7a) and (15)) (20) (cf (9) and (13)) .
Our scales show no difference, ^e con- clude that the electric fluids are also members of the family of weightless substances^ Further progress in the theory of electricity requires the introduction of two new concepts. Our sense of touch tells us quite definitely that one body is hot and another cold. Our situation is not comparable to anything in the past. Our situation is rendered more acute by other circum? Our small circle, then, stands for a sphere in space, say, the sun. Our space is finite, because, in consequence of the "growth" of the spheres, only a finite number of them can find room in space. Our starting-point is a classical example having nothing to do with modern physics. Our statis- tical view is gained by the knowledge of individual cases.
Our structure laws break down in regions of great energy concentration. Our task is to understand this consequence, to understand the meaning of the sentence: "Two events which are simultaneous in one c.s., may not be simultaneous in another c.s." Our task now is to describe the break brought about in science by these new concepts and to show how they gradually gained clarity and strength. Our time is rich in inventive minds, the inventions oE which could facilitate our lives considerably. Our train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised in the following manner. Our troubles are indeed much too profound to be solved in this way! Our two concepts of substance are, then, matter and energy.
Our use of the word therefore includes not only matter in the ordinary sense, but the electromagnetic field as well. Our visible spectrum begins with a certain wave- length for the violet colour and ends with a certain wave-length for the red colour. Our whole argument would fail! Our whole educational system suffers from this evil. Ourexperienceup to datejustifiesus in feelingsurethat in Nature is actualized the ideal of mathematical simplicity. Out of (16) it also follows that S V is a tensor which we may call the mixed fundamental tensor.
Out of the multitude of our sense experiences we take, mentally and arbitrarily, certain repeatedly occurring complexes of sense impression (partly in conjunction with sense impressions which are interpreted as signs for sense experiences of others ) , and we attribute to them a meaning-the meaning of the bodily object. Out of the totality of natural phenomena, we can, by successive higher approximations, deduce a coordinate system (,r, ^, ^, t) ; by means of this coordinate system, we can represent the phenomena according to definite laws. Out of these cells, p0?s may contain no melocule, p1?s may contain 1 molecule, p2?s may contain 2 molecules and so on.
Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists independently of us human beings and which stands before us like a great, eternal riddle, at least partially accessible to our inspection and thinking. Outer multiplication of Tensors :We get from the components of a tensor of rank z^ and another of a rank -', the components of a tensor of rank {z-^z') for which we multiply all the components of the first with all the components of the second in pairs. Outgoing radiation in the form of spherical waves does not exist. Outside of physics we know nothing of action at a distance. Overemphasis on the competitive system and premature spe?
Overlooking for t1te present the question as to the "cause" of such a gravitational field, which will occupy us later, there is nothing to prevent our conceiving this gravitational field as real, that is, the conception that K' is "at rest" and a gravitational field is present we may consider as equivalent to the conception that only K is an "allowable" system of co-ordinates and no gravitational field is present. Owing to his und isputed prestige and the respect which he enjoyed among scholars of ali countries, his end eavors met with success. Owing to the smallness of the effect in the case of the sun, it is difficult to form an opinion as to its existence.

Part II: The General Theory of Relativity. Part from the difficulty discussed in Section 21, there is a second fundamental difficulty attending classical celestial mechanics, which, to the best of my knowledge, was first discussed in detail by the astronomer Seeliger.
Partial differential equa- tions were not necessary for this purpose, nor did Newton make any systematic use of them ; but they were necessary for the formulation of the mechanics of deformable bodies ; this is connected with the fact that in these problems the question of how bodies are supposed to be constructed out of material points was of no importance to begin with. Particularly noteworthy among these were the Solvay Congresses, the first two of which were held at Brussels in 1909 and 1912.

People could either attempt to treat the forces which appear to us to act by contact as acting at a distance, though only making themselves felt at very small distances ; this was the way generally chosen by Newton's suc- cessors, who were completely under the spell of his teaching. People flatter me as long as I do not get in their way. People in America no doubt think as follows: "Let Europe go to the dogs, if it is destroyed by the quarrelsomeness and wickedness of its inhabitants. People seek to minimize the danger by limitation of armaments and restrictive rules for the conduct of war.
People travelling in this train will with a vantage view the train as a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate system); they regard all events in reference to the train. People's minds must, above all, be prepared for it. Perceptible bodies are obviously responsible for the concept of the material point ; people conceived it as an analogue of mobile bodies, stripping these of the characteristics of extension, form, orientation in space, and all inward" qualities,, leaving only inertia and translation and adding the concept of force. Perfection of means and confusion of goals seem in my opinion-to characterize our age. Perfections of means and confusion of goals seem-in mv opinion-to characterize our age.
Perhaps I am over-pessimistic concerning state and other forms of communal enterprise, but I expect little good from them. Perhaps I may be allowed a propos of this to make a few general remarks on the relation of my sphere of activity, which is theoretical physics, towards ex- perimental physics. Perhaps it is well that it should be. Perhaps the basic property of matter, its inertia, could be explained within the field theory? Perhaps the reader will wonder why we have placed our " beings " on a sphere rather than on another closed surface. Perhaps two-thirds of the people of the earth might be killed.

Personally, I feel that there is enough technical knowledge accumulated in the world to-day to make conditions such as we have in Germany unnecessary. Philosophical gener- alizations must be founded on scientific results. Photons are the energy quanta of which light is composed. Physical Meaning of the Equations Obtained in Respect to Moving Rigid Bodies and Moving Clocks. Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely de- termined by the external world. Physical events, in Newtons view, are to be re- garded as the motions, governed by fixed laws, of material points in space. Physical geometry is no longer an isolated self-con- tained science like the geometry of Euclid. Physical interpretation of space and time in classical mechanics.
Physical reality consists of a synthesis of all three. Physical space was thus increased to a four-dimensional space which also in- cluded the dimension of time. Physical space-time is perceived to be intimatel}' connected with the actual local distribution of matter. Physical theories try to form a picture of reality and to estab- lish its connection with the wide world of sense im- pressions. Physically the appearance of the second term on the lel't-hand side shows that for matter alone the law of con- servation of impulse and energy cannot hold ; or can only hold when f/^'''s are constants ; i.e., when the field of gravi- tation vanishes.
Physically, thf: occurrence of the second term on the lef t-hand side shQWB that laws of conservation of momentum and energy do not apply in the strict sense for matter alone, or else that they apply only when the g'" are constant, i.e. Physicists accepted this principle up to a few decades ago.

Political considerations, advanced with much solemnity, prevent the triumph of purely objective ways of thinking without which our great aims must necessarily be frustrated. Political in security owing to latent danger of war. Political insecu7ity owing to latent dan? Political leaders or governments owe their position partly to force and partly to popular election. Political liberty implies liberty to express one's political views orally and in writing, toleration, respect for any and every individual opinion. Political passion cannot be allowed to go to such lengths. Popper-Lynhaus was more than a brilliant engineer and writer. Popper-Lynkaeus was more than a brilliant engineer and writer.

Previously we proved that either (1) the quantum-mechanical description of reality given by the wave function is not complete or (2) when the operators corresponding to two physical quantities do not commute the two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality.
Previously, in the case of light waves and photons, it was shown that every statement formulated in the wave language can be translated into the language of photons or light corpuscles. Previously, when introducing new physical realities, such as the electromagnetic and gravitational field, we tried to indicate in general terms the characteristic features of the equations through which the ideas have been mathematically formulated. Primarily it is clear that on account of the j^roperty of homogeneity which we ascribe to time and space, the . Principle of Relativity [H.

Private capitai tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of the smaller ones. Probability waves in many dimensions corresponding to the many-particle pro- blem must be introduced. Probably never before has a theory been evolved which has given a key to the interpretation and calculation of such a heterogeneous group of phenomena of experience as has the quantum theory.

Pure logical thinking can give us no knowledge whatsoever of the world of experience; all knowledge about reality begins with experience and terminates in it. Pure logical thinking cannot yield us any knowledge of the empirical world ; all knowl- edge of reality starts from experience and ends in it.

Quantitatively it modified Newtons theory only slightly, but for that all the more profoundly qualita- tively. Quantum physics abandons individual laws of elementary particles and states directly the sta- tistical laws governing aggregations. Quantum physics deals only with aggregations, and its laws are for crowds and not for individuals. Quantum physics does not aim at the description of individual objects in space and their changes in time. Quantum physics formulates laws governing crowds and not individuals. Quantum physics gives its own prescription for treating a problem if we have previously been taught how to treat an analogous problem from the point of view of classical physics. Quantum physics teaches us how to formulate the mathematical equations for any of these problems.

Reading the character of the force from the drawing, we come once more to the conclusion that the force acts in a direction perpendicular to any line connecting the wire and the pole, for the tangent to a circle is always perpendicular to its radius. Real power is at present in the hands of few. Real security is tied to the denationalization of military power. Reality again limits the wealth of possibilities.
Really relativistic physics must apply to all c.s. Reason gives the structureto the system; the data of experienceand their mutual relationsare to correspondexactly to consequencesin the theory. Recapitulating, we may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an ether. Recently I find now, that one is able to dispense with hypothesis concerning the energy tensor of matter, if one fills in the energy tensor of matter into the field equations in a somehow different way than it was done in my two earlier reports.
Recently, however, I discovered, in collaboration with Dr. Rosen, that the above men:ioed simplest combination of the field equations of graVItation and electricity produces centrally symmetrical solutions which can be represented as free of singularity ( the well known centrally symmetrical solutions of Schwarzschild for the pure gravitational field, and those of Reissner for the electric field with consideration of its gravitational action ). Reduced to a formula, one might say simply that an empty stomach is not a good political adviser. Reduction in rank of a 7mxed Tenmr. Reference need only be made to America's participation in the World War to prove the need for such understanding. Referred to K, the radiation is isotropic, i.e.
Referred to a system of co-ordinates, the scene of any event will be determined (for the main part) by the specification of the lengths of the three perpendiculars or coordinates (x, y, z) which can be dropped from the scene of the event to those three plane surfaces. Referring back to the definition (67) for log .s', we find that the combinations lor (lor/)^ and lor (lor F* vanish identically, when /and F"^ are alternating matrices. Regarded from A-, we have the corresponding magnitudes : V 1 COR <J> A' = A a/ J.
Regarded from the moving system, the spherical surface becomes an ellipsoidal surface, having, at the time T=0, the equation : If S=volume of the sphei-e, S'=volume of this ellipsoid, then a simple calculation shows that : S 'JH cos $ c If E denotes the quantity of light energy measured in the stationary system, E' the quantity measured in the 4 26 PRINCIPLE OP RELATIVITY moving system, which are enclosed by the surfaces mentioned above, then A'' E 8 S' TT 8 S 1 - cos $ c TT If <l>= 0, we have the simple formula : E' E 1- V 1 + V J It is to be noticed that the energy and the frequency of a light-complex vary according to the same law with the state of motion of the observer.
Regarded in this way, the development of a science bears some resemblance to the compilation of a classified catalogue. Regarded not as a necessary, but merely as a sufficient, condition of reality, this criterion is in agreement with classical as well as quantum-mechanical ideas of reality. Regardless of the truth concerning details, there is no doubt that Galvani's accidental discovery led Volta at the end of the eighteenth century to the construction of what is known as a voltaic battery. Regulative measures by the community are needed to bring about a sound distribution of labour and consumption-goods among mankind; without them even the people of the richest country suffocate.

We advance a step farther in our generalisation when we express the tenet thus: If, relative to K, K1 is a uniformly moving co-ordinate system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run their course with respect to K1 according to exactly the same general laws as with respect to K. This statement is called the principle of relativity (in the restricted sense).
Relative to other reference-bodies K the law is not valid. Relativity theory does not alter our conception of radiation's structure; in particular, it does not affect the distribution of energy in radiation-filled space. Relativity theory gives us the means of calculating the energy emitted in the new reference frame. Relativity theory has changed our views on light. Relativity: The Special and General Theory. Religion and Science Everything that the human race has done and thought is concerned with the satisfaction of felt needs and the assuagement of pain. Religion is concerned with man's attitude toward nature at large, with the establishing of ideals for the individuai and communal!ife, and with mutual human relationship.
Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action: it can? Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action: t cannot justi? Religious truth conveys nothing clear to me at all. Relying on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it was discussed in the preceding section), the man in the chest will thus come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational field which is constant with regard to time. Relying on the equation of the ;^eodetie line, we can now easily deduce laws according to which new tensors can be formed from given tensors by differentiation. Remark : It is convenient to treat the scalar Invariant either as a contravariant or a co-variant tensor of zero rank.
Remarks on the Special Relativity Theory. Remember Oerstedt, who first discovered the magnetic influence of electro-magnetic currents; remember Reis, who first employed this influence to create sound in an electro-magnetic way; Bell, who, by using sensitive contacts, transferred sound waves with his microphone into variable electric currents. Remember thankfully the army of nameless technicians who simplified radio instruments and adapted them to mass production so that they became accessible to everybody. Remember that Switzerland represents a higher stage of political development than any national state, precisely because of the greater political problems which had to be solved before a stable community could be built up out of groups of different nationality.
Remember that difficulties and obstacles always form for any community a valuable source of strength and health. Remember that difficulties and obstacles are a valuable source of health and strength to any society. Remember that the average kinetic energy of the plate is one-third that of a monatomic gas molecule. Remembering (31), we thus have : Therefore (48) r an ^ _ f-a p/5 ^. Remembering this faet^ it suffices, for establishing the theorems (82) and (83) gener- ally, to prove it for the special case <t>i=o, w^=o, ta^=Of (ii^=i. Remembering this point it is clear that the full group belonging to Newtonian Mechanics is simply the group G^, with the value of c=oo. Repeated attempts were made to detect the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction.
Repeated experience would make us risk the further statement that we must push harder if we wish to move the body faster. Reply to the Women of America An American Women's League felt called upon to protest against Einstein's visit to their country. Required: the motion of the point relatively to the system K.

Restriction is justified only in so far as it may be needed for the security of existence.
Returning now to the general case contem- plated in Eqs. Returning to the comparatively simple question of determining the velocity of light, we may remark that it is surprising that Galileo did not realize that his experiment could be performed much more simply and accurately by one man. Returning to the illustration we have frequently used of the embankment and the railway carriage, we can express the fact of the motion here taking place in the following two forms, both of which are equally justifiable : (a) The carriage is in motion relative to the embankment, (b) The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage.

Riemann first extended Gauss's train of thought to continua of any number of dimensions; with prophetic vision he saw the physical meaning of this generalization of Euclid's geometry. Riemann's geometry will be the right thing if the laws of disposition of practically-rigid bodies are transformable into those of the bodies of Euclid's geometry with an exactitude which increases in proportion as the dimensions of the part of space-time under consideration are diminished. Riemanns geometry will be the right thing if the laws of disposition of practically-rigid bodies are transformable into those of the bodies of Euclids geometry with an exactitude which increases in proportion as the dimensions of the part of spacetime under consideration are diminished.
Right after the war, he joined the governing body of the "Conseil de recherche" which was founded by the scholars of the victorious countries, and from which the scholars and learned societies of the Centrai Powers were excluded.

SAGREDO: Well, Simplicio, the only thing I am able to infer from this familiar bit of experience is that sound, in reaching our ears, travels more slowly than light; it does not inform me whether the coming of the light is instantaneous or whether, although extremely rapid, it still occupies time .... SALVIATI: The small conclusiveness of these and other similar observations once led me to devise a method by which one might accurately ascertain whether illumination, i.e., propagation of light, is really instantaneous.

SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY. ' STRATIFICATION OF THE SCIENTIFIC SYSTEM. Sa far as I can judge, the English school system comes nearest to the realization of this ideai. Sbould language predominate or teclmical education in science?
Scattered over the wide world, our nation possessed nothing in common except its carefully guarded tradition. Schemati- cally this arrangement can be represented by an arrow directed from the negatively charged conductor to the positive one. Schematically, the transition from Newton's gravitational law to general relativity resembles the transition from the theory of electric fluids with Coulomb's law to Maxwell's theory. Schlick in his book on epistemology has therefore characterised axioms very aptly as "implicit definitions." Schlick in his book on epistemology has therefore characterised axioms very aptly as implicit definitions.
Schopenhauer's saying, "A man can do what he wants, but not want what he wants," has been a very real inspiration to me since my youth; it has been a continual consolation in the face of life's hardships, my own and others', and an unfailing well-spring of tolerance. Schopenhauer's saying, that "a man can do as he will, but not will as he will," has been an inspiration to me since my youth up, and a continual consolation and unfailing well-spring of patience in the face of the hardships of life, my own and others'. Science and investigation recognize as their aim the truth only. Science concerns the totality of the primary concepts, i.e. Science connecting theory and experiment really began with the work of Galileo.
Science did not succeed in carrying out the mechanical programme convincingly, and today no physicist believes in the possibility of its fulfilment. Science exists for Science's sake, like Art for Art's sake, and does not go in for special pleading or for the demonstration of absurdities. Science forces us to create new ideas, new theories. Science has therefare been charged witl1 undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. Science is not and will never be a closed book. Science is not just a collection of laws, a catalogue of unrelated facts. Science is the century-old endeavor to bring together by means of systematic thought the perceptible phenomena of this world into as thorough? Science is the century-old endeavor to.
Science uses the totality of the primary concepts, i.e., concepts directly connect ed with sense experiences, and proposi of concepts. Science, however, cannot create ends and, even less, instill them in human beings; science, at most, can supply the means by which to attain certain ends. Science, in consequence, has been accused of undermining morals but wrongly. Scienti:fc statements of facts and relations, indeed, cannot produce ethical directives. Scientific concepts often begin with those used in ordinary language for the affairs, of everyday life, but they develop quite differently. Scientific enterprises all over the civilized world rejoice in the liberal support of American institutions and individuals a fact which is, I am sure, a source of pride and gratification to all of you.
Scientific ima- gination finds old concepts too confining, and replaces them by new ones. Second, socialism is directed towards a social-ethical end. Second, t11e teacber sbould be given extensive liberty in the selection of the materiai to be taugbt and t11e metbods of teaching employed by bim. Second, the method of representation t the UN should be considerably modifed. Second, the teacber sbould be given extensive liberty in the selection of the materia! Second, we had to give up hope that through the presence of the ether-sea one c.s. Secondly, if we adopt this view, we fail to comply with the requirement of the relativity of inertia. Secretary of the League of Nations.
Security for the United States, as for other countries, lies only in a satisfactory solution of the world peace problem. See '' Electrodynamics of Afoving Bodies," p. 5-S. NOTES 17 Not 6. See Lorentz, Theory of Electrons (English edition), 181, page tllS. See to it that the will-power and the talents of the youth of to-day do not perish to the grievous hurt of the community as a whole. Separate courts of arbitration for Europe with Africa, America, and Asia (Australia to be apportioned to one of these). Seven years later at the age of eighty, about to be deported , Berliner committed suicid e. I should like to take this opportunity of telling my friend Jlerliner and the readers of this periodica! Shall we worry over the fact that we are living in a time of danger and want?
Sharp shadows would not be possible if the wave theory of light were correct, for waves would bend around the edges of the paper and thus blur the shadow. Shaw is undoubtedly one of the world's greatest figures, both as a writer and as a man. She felt herself at every moment to be a servant of society, and her profound modesty never lef t any room for complacency. She for the first time created the intellectual miracle of a logical system, the assertions of which followed one from another with such rigor that not one of the demonstrated propositions admitted of the slightest doubt-Euclid's geometry. She may then insist on only the neces? She was opa pressed by an abiding sense for the asperities and inequities of society.
Shortly I can signify the third axiom as ; {m, ie), and {}f, iE) are space-time vectors of the second kind, (C, ip) is a space-time vector oP the first kind. Should \/ g vanish at any point of the four-dimensional continuum it would si^nifv that to a finite co-ordinate volume at the place corresponds an iiifiuitely small " natural volume." Should it ever be my fate to be repre- sented as a b^e noire, I should, on the contrary, become a Swiss Jew" for the Germans and a Ger- man savant" for the English. Should it not be possible to explain the total inertia of the particles electromagnetically? Should language predominate or technical edu?
Should the independence of physical laws of the state of motion of the co-ordinate system be restricted to the uniform translatory motion of co- ordinate systems in respect to each other ? Should truth, far instance, be sought uncondition? Should we be justified in saying that for this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the fieldequations of Maxwell in electrodynamics ? Should we not do everything in our power to eliminate the danger which threatens all nations alike? Should we try to follow our old path, or seek a new one? Similar theorems hold with reference to the magnetic force. Similarly iJX 11 iJX,, being the outer product of two vBctors, is a tensor.
Similarly let us consider two positions of the pointers of a clock which is at rest with reference to a co-ordinate system ; then to these positions, there always curresponds, a time-interval of a definite length, independent of time and place. Similarly motivated men of the present and of the past, as well as the insights which they had achieved, were the friends which could not be lost. Similarly the rhythm of a moving clock is slowed down, compared to the clocks it passes along the rod, and would come to a stop if the clock were to move with the speed of light, that is, if the clock is a "good" one.
Similarly we can get its co-ordinate-length in a tangential position, if we put for example we then get (71a) l = f/22 '^K = <^ 2 T 2 2 The gravitational field has no influence upon the length of the rod, when we put it tangeatially in the field. Similarly we get from the tensors A and B^^ through outer multiplication and two-fold reduction the inner product A B^*' . Similarly we see that the antisymmetrical tensor of the tbird rank A"'"u has only four numerically different components, while the antisymmetrical tensor A"'"uT has only one. Similarly, for three, four, and more particles the probability waves will be functions in a continuum of nine, twelve, and more dimensions.
Similarly, in the kinetic theory of matter, we have statistical laws governing the aggregation, gained on the basis of individual laws. Similarly, it cannot be said a priori that statements about the form of objects in K will also be valid in K'. Similarly, standing waves can have four, five, and more nodes. Similarly, the world of physical phenomena which was briefly called " world " by Minkowski is naturally four dimensional in the space-time sense. Similarly, this universe has a finite area that can be compared with the area, of a square constructed with rods. Similarly, to know the birth rate of a great com- munity does not mean knowing whether any particular family is blessed with a child.
Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with the velocity v to be continued across the whole of space, so that every event, no matter how far off it may be, could also be localised with respect to the second framework. Similarly, we must claim here that the electric field exists without the wire testing the presence of an induced current. Similarly, when the sphere contracts, the density of that part of the medium immediately surrounding it will be decreased. Simple Derivation of the Lorentz Transformation. Simple dimensional analysis shows that this variation must be of the form of the second term of our formula.
Simply because under closer inspection the real solid bodies in nature are not rigid, because their geometrical behaviour, that is, their possibilities of relative disposition, depend upon temperature, external forces, etc. Simply because we, on our earth, are to a certain extent in the same position. Simply that there exists one c.s. Simultaneously the strongest military powers could draf t the working papers for a supranational security organization and for an arbitration committee, as well as the legai basis for, and the precise stipulation of, obligations, competencies, and restrictions of the latter with respect to the individuai nations.
Since (It is always greater than cIt we may call the quotient - '^ as the ^^ Gain " (vorgehen) of the time (It over the proper-time of the material point and the law can then be thus expressed ;The kinetic energ}- of a ma- terial point is the product of its mass into the gain of the time over its proper-time. Since Galileo's time we have been able to predict the co-ordinate of the stone at any arbitrary instant after it was dropped. Since I cannot assume that everyone is familiar with this theory, I will cover its essential points briefly. Since I do not foresee that atomic energy is to be a great boon for a long time, I have to say that for the present it is a menace.
Since K' is not an inertial system, we do not know directly the laws of configuration of rigid bodies with respect to K', nor the laws of nature, in general. Since PQ QP = 1(/2mi, we have shown that it is in general possible for P~ and p to be eigenfunctions of two noncom- muting operators, corresponding to physical quantities. Since according to our present conceptions the elementary particles of matter are also, in their essence, nothing else than condensations of the electromagnetic field, our present view of the universe presents two realities which are completely separated from each other conceptually, although connected causally, namely, gravitational ether and electromagnetic field, oras they might also be calledspace and matter.
Since according to our present-day notions the pri- mary particles of matter are also, at bottom, nothing but condensations of the electro-magnetic field, our modern schema of the cosmos recognizes two realities which are conceptually quite independent of each other even though they may be causally connected, namely the gravitational ether and the electro-magnetic field, or as one might call them space and matter. Since all falling bodies have the same constant acceleration, the two masses must be equal. Since all points of our continuum are on an equal footing, it is sufficient to carry tbrough the calculation for one point, e.g. Since as follows from the theorem of addition of velocities ( 5)Nthe vector (u?,u?,u?)
Since at this stage RELIGION AND SCIENCE 37 of existence understanding of causal connections is usually paorly developed, the human mind creates illusory beings more or less analogous to itself on whose wills and actions these fear? Since at this stage of existence understanding of causal connexions is usually poorly developed, the human mind creates for itself more or less analogous beings on whose wills and actions these fearful happenings depend. Since dE is equal to the heat added and since the process is reversible, the following statement also applies dS = (1/T) dE. Since each S'/, as a function of (;r, ^, 0, ^) vanishes for the zero-value of the paramater A., so in o:eneral ->r^ =c, for X = o. Since equation (8a) must hold for points on the x-axis, we thus have _ = I.
Since for the origin of K', i.e., for x'1 = 0, we must have x1 = vl , it follows from the first of these equations that v = itan? Since further, [i,uv = g 11, it follows from the considerations of the preceding paragraph that gv is a covariant tensor of the second rank. Since he cannot allow the velocity of light to depend explicitly upon the time in the way under consideration he will interpret his observation by saying that the clock on the periphery actully goes slower than the clock at the origin. Since he classes his absolute space together with real things, for him rotation relative to an absolute space is also something real. Since he now knows exactly where to look for it, he may go out, if he likes, to collect further con- firmation for his theory.
Since he regards his absolute space as a real thing, rotation with respect to an ab- solute space is also something real to him. Since here SL = LS, we deduce that, F*/*/F = (-S-L) (S-L) = - SS + L% and find, since/*/ = Det "^ f, F* F = Det ^ F, we arrive at the interesting conclusion * Vide note 18. Since in reality the detailed distribution of matter is not uniform, the real universe will deviate in individual parts from the spherical, i.e. Since in these pages we do this consistently, we must occasionally restrict our- selves to quoting, without proof, some of the results necessary for an understanding of important clues arising in the further development.
Since it had been realized that electrical masses in motion produce a magnetic field, whose energy acted as a model for inertia, inertia also appeared as a field-action localized in the ether. Since it has often been contended by opponents of the theory of relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the general theory of relativity, it is perhaps advisable to make the facts of the case clearer by means of an appropriate comparison.
Since it would have seemed ut- terly absurd to the physicists of the nineteenth cen- tury to attribute physical functions or states to space itself, they invented a medium pervading the whole of space, on the model of ponderable matter the ether, which was supposed to act as a vehicle for electro-magnetic phenomena, and hence for those of light also. Since its extension by Sommerfeld and Epstein, this may well be claimed to have become a safely established part of our science. Since light also propagates in material objects, one had to assume that this ether was also present in material objects, and was chiefly responsible for the propagation of light in material objects.
Since light can also propagate through empty space, one had to imagine a strange substance, an ether, that mediated the propagation of light waves. Since m is an invariant (tensor of rank 0), ? Since one particle is indivisible, we cannot imagine that it passes through both the holes. Since science has not yet found protection from these weapons, the modem state is no longer in a position to prepare adequately for the safety of its citizens. Since such fields also occur in vacuoi.e. Since such fields are also found in a vacuum i.e., in the unoccupied ether the ether also appears as the substratum of electro-magnetic fields, entirely simi- lar in nature to ponderable matter and ranking alongside it.
Since that time each generation has built up the heritage of knowledge and understanding, without the slightest danger of a crisis that might jeopardize the whole structure. Since that time, the age of Galileo and Newton, the reading has proceeded rapidly. Since the " answering " motion is always the same all bodies dropped from the same height fall in the same way it must be deduced that gravitational mass and inertial mass are equal. Since the United States and Great Britain have the secret of the atomic bomb and the Soviet Union does not, they should invite the Soviet Union to prepare and present the first draft of a constitution of the proposed world govern?
Since the action of negative on negative is repulsion, the two leaves try to get as far from each other as possible and the result is the observed separation. Since the completion of the first atomic bomb nothing has been accomplished to make the world more safe from war, while much h.s been done to increase the destructiveness of war. Since the days of these first experiments the very im- portant number representing the velocity of light has been determined many times, with increasing accuracy. Since the foregoing theory allows interaction only by fields, it requires a field theory of gravitation. Since the gravitational field is determined by the configuration of masses and changes with it, the geometric structure of this space is also dependent on physical factors.
Since the integrals of Tx11 , Tx22 and Tx33 vanish because the T? Since the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been justified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must feel the temptation to venture the step towards the general principle of relativity. Since the modern physicist does not consider himself entitled to assume that, this view brings him back to the ether, which has to act as the medium of inertial action. Since the operator corresponding to the momentum of the particle is p = (h/2rri) 8/Bx, we obtain p' =pp = (h/2iri) 8$/Bx =p pp (4) Thus, in the state given by Eq. Since the pictures are taken simultaneously, we can compare the marks on the c.s. Since the pressures are equal, the two pistons are bombarded with the same total force.
Since the publication of the first edition of this little book, our knowledge about the structure of space in the large (" cosmological problem ") has had an important development, which ought to be mentioned even in a popular presentation of the subject. Since the quantities themselves may be presumed to transform in the same way as their increments, we infer that the aggregate of the four quantities Ix, Iy, Iz, iE has itself vector character; these quantities are referred to an instantaneous condition of the body (e.g. Since the real purpose of socialism is precisely to overcome and advance beyond the predatory phase of human develop?
Since the real purpose of socialism is precisely to overcome and advance beyond the predatory phase of human development, economic science in its present state can throw little light on the socialist society of the future.Second, socialism is directed towards a social-ethical end. Since the reciprocal action of bodies was supposed to be accomplished through fields, there had also to be a gravitational field in the ether, whose field-law had, however, assumed no clear form at that time. Since the relations between (,(/, ^', z\ f), and (x, y, z, t) do not contain time explicitly, therefore K and k' are relatively at rest.
Since the repulsive forces must increase with the density, the tendency of the charge to escape will be greater in the case of the smaller sphere than in that of the larger. Since the same light-signal has to be transmitted relative to K1 with the velocity c, the propagation relative to the system K1 will be represented by the analogous formula x' - ct' = O . Since the starting-point does not matter, these vectors can represent the velocities of four cars moving away from the same traffic roundabout, or the velocities of four cars in different parts of the country travelling with the indicated speeds in the indicated directions. Since the sun S and the lantern M can both be seen from the Earth, the angle at E in the triangle SEM is known.
Since the temperatue is the same, so, according to the theory, is the average kinetic energy per particle. Since the time of Copernicus we have known that the earth rotates on its axis and moves around the sun. Since the time of Leverrier, it has been known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury, after it has been corrected for the influences mentioned above, is not stationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that it rotates exceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the sense of the orbital motion. Since the understanding of causal connections is usually limited on this level of existence, the human soul forges a being, more or less like itself, on whose will and activities depend the experiences which it fears.
Since the velocity depends on the medium through which the light is passing, it will be different in glass from the velocity in empty space. Since the velocity distribution is supposed to remain constant with time, the average of the absolute value of the above quantity must be equal to Mv; the mean values of the squares of these quantities, taken over a long time interval or over a large number of molecules, must therefore be equal: (Mv Rvr + A)2 = (M). Since then many scientists have zealously sought to complete the :field theory by some generalization that should comprise a theory of matter; but so far such efforts have not been crowned with success. Since there are no external forces acting, the motions are perfectly uniform.
Since there can be only one physical condition of B af ter the interaction and which can reasonably not 'be considered as dependent on the particular measurement we perform on the system A sepa? Since these terms must be symmetrical tensors, the only ones which enter will be ? Since they diverge from one point, they are dense near the sphere and become less and less so farther away. Since this expression will be used very often, we shall simply write c.s. Since this factitious mass-density would have to be enormously small, it could make its presence felt only in gravitating systems of very great extent. Since this factitious massdensity would have to be enormously small, it could make its presence felt only in gravitating systems of very great extent.
Since this hypothesis has already been abandoned, I won't bring any arguments against it. Since this identity of inertial and gravitational mass was fundamental for the formulation of the theory of relativity, we are justified in examining it a little more closely here. Since this is the case for an arbitrary choice of the dx?, it follows that A; ?= Ax? Since unemployed and poorly paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of con? Since unemployed and poorly paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers' goods is restricted, and great hardship is the consequence.
Since we are accustomed to consider that these limitations represent in a unique way the actual facts very approximately, we maintain that the simultaneity of two events exists of themselves.^ In fact, the following considerations will prove conclusive. Since we are dealing here only with the foundations of physics and with its develop? Since we are looking for a space which exceeds Riemannian space in wealth of structure, the obvious thing is to enrich Riemannian space by adding the relation of direction or parallelism. Since we have no mechanical picture of the ether, it is extremely difficult to answer this question.
Since we have seen that changes in (1) and (2) lead to contradiction with experiment, we must have the courage to state their validity clearly and to attack the one possibly weak point, the way in which positions and velocities are transformed from one c.s. Since we were specifically concerned with the systematic effect of v on the momentum of the molecule, we shall have to neglect the average value vA. Since we wish to deal with the important problem of two c.s.
Since, f urther, we presuppose independence of the time co-ordmate x 4 for all magnitudes, we may demand for the required solution that, for all x., (7) Further, as always with static problems, we shall have to set gl4 = g24 = g34 = o (8) It remain s now to determine those components of the gravitational potential which define the purely spatial-geo? Since, however, sense perception only gives informa- tion of this external world or of physical reality" indirectly, we can only grasp the latter by speculative means. Since, however, the phenomena to be dealt with were much more complicated than that, the task was a far harder one.
Since, under present circumstances, free and unhindered discussion of these problems has come under a powerful taboo, I consider the foundation of this magazine to be an important public service. Sir, In your letter to the Prussian Academy of Sciences you have given the present state of affairs in Germany as the reason for your resignation. Situated as it is on the borderland between the Orient and the Occident, the Jewish National Home may be able to play an important part in the development of a new humanity. Six or seven men, or more, probably would fail. Slowly and by a struggle the field concept established for itself a leading place in physics and has remained one of the basic physical concepts. Small is the number of them that see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts.
So I think that for the present we may base our reasoning upon the following approximative assumption. So a friend of mine, a Swiss professor, once wrote in his facetious way to a university faculty which had annoyed him. So a friend of mine, a Swiss professor, once wrote in his irritable way to a university faculty which had annoyed him. So also are the concepts of Euclidean and non-Eucli- dean geometry, and our space understood as a three- dimensional continuum. So also the arrows indicating "uptown" and "downtown" subway trains in New York must point in opposite directions. So as to have a definite picture, we may assume the two directions perpendicu- lar to each other.
So by the addition of two 3-space volumes, w^e do not obtain a vector of a more general type, but one which can alwavs be represented bv a four-vector (h)C, cit. So different is the mean- ing of the word truth according to whether we are dealing with a fact of experience, a mathematical proposition or a scientific theory. So early as 1881, J. J. Thomson had shown that the inertia of a charged })article increased with its velocity. So far as I personally am concerned, I can defend myself against an objection of this sort by assuring you that it was no suggestion of mine but the generous invitation of others which has placed me on this dais, which commemorates a man who spent his life in striving for the unification of knowledge. So far our attention has been focused on Faraday's experiment.
So far the United States has shown no interest in preserv? So far the general theory of relativity has made no change in this state of the question. So far this has not been found; accordingly the field theory has not suc? So far we have considered the electron in some ex- ternal field. So far we have not bothered to describe the frame when quoting the laws of mechanics, because we happen to live on the earth and there is no difficulty in any particular case in fixing a frame of reference, rigidly connected with the earth. So far we have tried to show what led to the fundamental assumptions of the relativity theory, and how the theory forced us to revise and to change the classical transformation by treating time and space in a new way.
So far, these considerations hold for a continuum of two dimensions. So he plays his violin, or lounges in his armchair en- joying a pipe, when suddenly, by Jove, he has it ! So he will be obliged to defme time in such a way that the rate of a clock depends upon where the clock may be. So if we wish to contemplate the possi? So it seems impossible to estimate the mean density. So it would be well for the United States and other powers not to permit the Russians to veto an attempt to create supranational security. So long as international relations are determined by rival national sove- reignties, the threat of atomic war will remain. So long as the important mathematical difficulties con?
So long as the individual state, despite its officiai condemnation of war, has to consider the possibility of engaging in war, it must influence and educate its citizens-and its youth in par? So long as we are concerned only with fundamental physical ideas we may avoid the language of mathematics. So long as we ourselves care about this community it will continue to exist to the benefit of mankind, in spite of the fact that it possesses no self-contained organization. So stupendous and unique a task as the up-building of Palestine must take a course of constant, gradual development. So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these motions only to systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed stars do not move in a circle.
So that nothing remains for us but to regard all conceivable co-ordinate systems as equally suitable for the description of natural phenomena. So that we got^ <T fj^jS 1 6 .7 afS 2 6.(. So that, if it were certain that the field equations (13) which I bave hitherto employed were the only ones compatible with the posiulate of genera! So the two events can now be comprehended to be simultaneous. So there is nothing for it but to regard all imaginable systems of co-ordinates, on principle, as equally suitable for the description of nature. So these two groups lead quite separate existences besides each other. So they may believe it is super:B.uous to announce publicly that they will not a second time be the frst to use the atomic bomb.
So though the release of atomic energy can be, and no doubt will be, a great boon to mankind, that may not be for some time. So upon the ground of symmetry alone of the equa- tions (A) and (B) concerning the sitffiies (1, 2, 3, 4), the theorem of Relativity, which was found out by Lorentz, follows without any calculation at all. So we came to a more general law : Let ? So we have K. The kinetic energy of the body with respect to (?,?,?) So we see that we cannot attach any absolute signification to the concept of simultaneity, but that two events which, viewed from a system of co-ordinates, are simultaneous, can no longer be looked upon as simultaneous events when envisaged from a system which is in motion relatively to that system.
So while persons who take only a step at a time may think they are approaching world peace, they actually are contributing by their slow pace to the coming of war. So why not measure the mass increase, or weight increase, connected with this cbange? So, if one regards as possible, gravi- tational fields of arbitrary extension which are not initially restricted by spatial limitations, the concept of the "inertial system" becomes completely empty. So, tao, we are unable to introduce a time corresponding to physical requirements in K', ind1cated by clocks at resti relatively to K'.
So, too, in the generai case, when we are no longer able by a suitable choice of co-ordinates to apply the special theory of relativity to fl,finite region, we sball bold fast to the view that the gu-r describe the gravitational feld. So, will the initiated please pardon me, if part of what I shall bring forward has long been known? Society and Personality When we survey our lives and endeavours we soon observe that almost the whole of our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings. Sodium atoms, for example, emit yellow light with a definite wavelength. Some Aspects of the Fundamental Tensor g,,..

Some Notes on my American Impressions I must redeem my promise to say something about my impressions of this country. Some difficulty is caused by the fact that a magnetic pole exists only in connection with another magnetic pole, forming a dipole. Some essential lines of thought have been left out, not because they seemed to us unimportant, but because they do not lie along the road we have chosen. Some features of the theory are certainly unsatisfactory if not discouraging. Some few rapidly made a position for themselves in the higher walks of business and social life. Some may, perhaps, find it helpful to regard these lines as something more than drawings, and to imagine the real actions of force pass- ing through them.
Some new deductions, not contained in Newton's law, come from the new gravitational laws. Some notion of the theory makes them understandable. Some of his books were banned in 1mperial Austria. Some of the electrons may pass through the first hole and others through the second. Some of the riddles of nature have been solved, although many of the solutions have proved temporary and superficial in the light of further research. Some of the spectrum lines are very distinct, others are fainter. Some of these factors are not far to seek. Some people also in sucb a way bave tried to prove pseudo-scientifcally the necessity of the destructive eco? Some people also in such a way have tried to prove pseudo?
Some physicists, among them myself, can not believe that we must abandon, actually and forever, the idea of direct representation of physical reality in space and time; or that we must accept the view that events in nature are analogous to a game of chance. Some recent work by Z-Forai and L. Szilerd, which has been com communicated to me in manuscript, led me to expect that the element uran- fum may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the in mediate future. Some- thing deeply hidden had to be behind things. Some- thing will happen if the bars are magnetized at all. Somebody who reads only newspapers and at best books of . Someone once discovered the use of lire, someone the cultiva? Someone, indeed, might even raise the question whether, without some?
Someone, indeed, might even raise the question whether, without something of this illusion, anything really great can be achieved in the realm of philosophic thought-but we do not wish to ask this question.E This more aristocratic illusion concerning the unlimited penetrative power of thought has as its counterpart the more plebeian illusion of na1ve realism, according to which things "are" as they are perceived by us through our senses. Something more than kinetic and potential energies is now involved, namely, the heat created by friction. Something of the same sort confronts us in the electro-magnetic field. Sometimes a simple generaliza- tion of the old ideas seems, at least temporarily, to be a good way out.
Sometimes one sees in the school simply the instrument far transferring a certain maximum quantity of knowledge to the growing generation. Sometimes one sees in the school simply the instrument for transferring a certain maximum quantity of knowledge to the growing generation. Somewhere in the centre there is a sphere. Somewhere in the vicinity is a magnetic field. Soon, however, I cllicovered that it is easier to give such a promise than to fulfill it. Soon, however, I discovered that it is easier to give such a promise than to fulfill it. Sooner or later the uniformly moving body will collide with the wall of the lift, destroying the uniform motion. Sooner or later the whole lift will collide with the earth, destroying the observers and their experiments.
Sound waves spread in air, ocean waves in water. Sound waves, on the other hand, furnish the most familiar example of longitudinal waves. Soviet scientists, and the Soviet people in general, are appreciative of the humanitarian spirit which prompts these activities of the scientist, although his position has not always been as consistent and clear-cut as might be desired. Space and Time in Classical Mechanics. Space and time as measured by two different observers are natur- ally diverse, and the difference depends only on their relative motion. Space and time were thereby divested not of their reality but of their causal abso- luteness (absoluteness affecting but not affected) which Newton had been compelled to ascribe to them in order to be able to give expression to the laws then known.
Space and time, therefore, cannot be defined with respect to K' as they were in the special theory of relativity with respect to inertial systems. Space as a continuum does not figure in the conceptual system at all. Space has a Riemannian metric. Space is a three-dimensional continuum. Space is homogeneous, that is to say, the same spherical configurations are possible in the environment of all points. Space is homogeneous, that is to say, the same spherical configurations are possible in the environment of all points.1 Our space is finite, because, in consequence of the growth of the spheres, only a finite number of them can find room in space. Space, time and matter (or energy) were considered to be the three ultimate elements in Physics.
Space, time and matter taken separatel}" are more abstractions. Space-time regions of finite extent are, in general, not Galilean, so that a gravitational field cannot be done away with by any choice of co-ordinates in a finite region. Space-time vectors of the fir'<f and the second kind. Space: in this interpretation is in principle an infinite rigid. Speaking of currents in a wire, of charged conductors, of electromagnetic waves, we can apply our old simple physics contained in Maxwell's equations. Special Lorentz Transformation.

Specialization in every sphere of intellectual work is producing an everwidening gulf between the intellectual worker and the non-specialist, which makes it more difficult for the life of the nation to be fertilized and enriched by the achievements of art and science. Specifications of time were independent of the choice of the space of reference. Spinoza and Karl Marx are the children of this tradition. Sprung in the first piace from the fears which filled man's daily lif e, the belief in the existence of such beings, and in their extraordinary powers, has had so strong an influence on men and their conduct, that it is dillcult for us to imagine. Standing alongside of each other on the range are two pans so much alike that one may be mistaken for the other.
Starting as a helpful model, the field became more and more real. Starting from Boltzmann's 36 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY theorem connecting the entropy, and the probability of a state, he deduced a formula on the mean displacement of small particles (colloidal) suspended in a liquid. Starting from a point, they draw " straight lines " (arcs of circles as judged in three dimensional space) of equal length in all directions. Starting out from this basic notion he discovered that osteomyelon and periosteum prevent each other's growth if they are not separated from each other by bone.
Starting then with the assumption that the wave function does give a complete description of the physical reality, we arrived at the conclusion that two physical quantities, with rioncommuting oper- ators, can have simultaneous reality. State-probability and entropy. Stated more exactly, there are finite regions, where, with respect to a suitably chosen space of reference, material particles move freely without acceleration, and in which the laws of the special theory of relativity, which have been developed above, hold with remarkable accuracy.
Stated more exactly: When two clocks arranged at rest in different places of a reference-body are set in such a manner that a particular position of the pointers of the one clock is simultaneous (in the above sense) with the same position, of the pointers of the other clock, then identical " settings " are always simultaneous (in the sense of the above definition). Statistical laws can be applied only to big aggregations, but not to their individual members. Still less was there a conviction that all that happens in nature is subject to inexorable laws. Still more-does this correctapproachexist at all, save in our imagination? Still the question is not without a formal in terest, whether with a correspondingly generalized definition of the energy?
Still the question is not without formal interest, whether, when the energy-components of the gravitation -field and matter is defined in a generalised manner without any specialisation of co-ordinates, the laws of con- servation have the form of the equation (56), and the fiela- equations of gravitation hold in the form (52) or (52a) ; such that on the left-hand side, we have a divergence in the usual sense, and on the right-hand side, the sum of the energy-components of matter and gravitation. Stokes assumed that viscous motion ensues near the surface of separation of ether and moving matter, w^hile at sufficiently distant regions the ether remains wholly undisturbed.
Stokes himself had shown that his ether must be incom- pressible and all motion in it differentially irrotational, at the same time there should be absolutely no slipping at the surface of separation. Strange as this analogy may seem, let us draw further conclusions from it and try to proceed with the com- parison, once having chosen it. Strange things happen in the lift! Strictly speaking, such an 34ther-drift ought also to be assumed relative to the earth, and for a long time the efforts of physicists were devoted to attempts to detect the existence of an 34ther-drift at the earth's surface. Stripes appear instead of rings. Sub specie aeterni Poincare, in my opinion, is right. Subject to fine if kept beyond date due. Subjects of our perception are always connected with place and time.
Subsequently I discovered, in conjunction with my colleague, that these spinors form a special case of a new sort of field, mathematically connected with the four-dimensional system, which we called semivectors. Substituting the value of if/, we get 9;c Qa' ds ds 9' ds^ GENERALISED THEORY OF RELATIVITY HI Here however we can not at once deduce the existence of any tensor. Subtracting the scalar equation multiplied by t, we next obtain. Sucb a psycbological foundation alone leads to a joyous desire for the bigbest possessions of men, knowl? Sucb a school demands from the teacber that be be a kind of artist in his province.
Success alone can decide as to the justification of such an attempt, which postulates physical reality for the fundamental principles of Riemann's geometry outside of the domain of their physical definitions. Success alone can decide as to the justification of such an attempt, which postulates physical reality for the fundamental principles of Riemanns geometry outside of the domain of their physical definitions. Success on a Jarge scale will take time, but it will undoubtedly come. Success on a large scale will take time, but it will undoubtedly come. Successful revolt against the accepted view results in unexpected and completely different develop- ments, becoming a source of new philosophical aspects.
Such a conception corresponds exactly to the precedence of the concept of the rigid ( or quasi rigid ) body in the interpretation of the concept of space. Such a definition is in fact sufficient, when it is required to define time exclusively for the place at which the clock is stationed. Such a finite material universe would be destined to become gradually but systematically impoverished. Such a force either increases or decreases the velocity according to whether it acts in the direction of motion or in the opposite direction. Such a local n-leg is to be found in every other point P' of space also. Such a measurement how- ever disturbs the particle and thus alters its state.
Such a misconception is possible only because one does not easily become aware of the free choice of such con- cepts, which, through verification and long usage, appear to be immediately connected with the empirical mate- rial. Such a partial world govemment should make it clear from the beginning that its doors remain wide open to any non? Such a person no doubt loses something in the way of geniality and light-heartedness ; on the other hand, he is largely independent of the opinions, habits, and judgments of his fellows and avoids the temptation to take his stand on such insecure foundations. Such a preconception would be an extraordinary triumph for pure mathematics.
Such a process of amalgamation might extend to larger and larger combinations, and finally lead to an "international police," which would be bound gradually to degenerate as international security increased. Such a psychological foundation alone leads to a joyous desire far the highest possessions of men, knowledge and artist? Such a quantity, possessing both magnitude and direction, is called a vector. Such a regulation would undoubtedly produce a great moral effect. Such a scalar theory of the gravitational field can easily be made invariant under the group of Lorentz-transformations. Such a scbool demands from the teacher tbat be be a kind of artist in his province. Such a small body is often called a particle. Such a state of affairs cannot, how relations.
Such a state of affairs cannot, however, satisfy a spirit which is really scien? Such a statement would be justifi.ed if the United States had made a serious attempt in this direction during the past year. Such a story presents all the essential clues, and com- pels us to form our own theory of the case. Such a system of particles behaves like a small acoustical instrument in which standing waves are produced. Such a testimony would not be, as you put it, a good word for the German nation; on the contrary, it would only have helped the cause of those who are seeking to undermine the ideas and principles which have won for the German nation a place of honour in the civilized world.
Such a theoretical structure needs to be very thoroughly elaborated before it can lead to conclusions which can be compared with experience. Such a universe might fittingly be called a quasi-Euclidean universe. Such alteration of the co-ordinates (by transforma- tion) is permitted in the special theory of relativity, since in the new co-ordinates too the magnitude ds^ (fundamental invariant) is expressed in the new dif- ferentials of the co-ordinates by the sum of the squares. Such altered characteristics of space and time give a satisfactory explanation of an outstanding discrepancy in the observed advance of perihelion of Mercury.
Such an association would, of course, be a prey to all the ills which so often lead to degeneration in learned societies, dangers which are inseparably bound up with the imperfection of human nature. Such an assumption is, spondingly small probability, a consequence in perfect har? Such an assumption naturally gave rise to an atomic theory of electricity, namely, the modern electron theory. Such an asymmetry of the theoretical structure, to which there is no corresponding asymmetry in the system of empirical facts, is intolerable to the theorist. Such an atmosphere is a necessary prerequisite for the fruitful development of politica!cooperation. Such an attempt was successful about i ten years ago, through the agency of two entirely different theoretical methods of attack.
Such an attitude is at once base and shortsighted. Such an element becomes an instrument, a concept- I think that the transition from free associa- tion or "dreaming" to thinking is characterized by the more or less dominating role which the ^'concept'' plays in it. Such an expression is justified only when the conclusions drawn from it are confirmed by experiment. Such an ideai of external liberty can never be fully attained but must be sought unre? Such an ideal of external liberty can never be fully attained but must be sought unremittingly if scientific thought, and philosophical and creative thinking in generai, are to be ad? Such an interpretation eliminates also the paradox recently I demonstrated by myself and two collaborators, and which relates to the following problem.
Such an interpretation is arrived at by an extension of the principle of rela- tivity to co-ordinate systems accelerated relatively to one another. Such an interval can be oriented at rest, relatively to our space of reference, in a multiplicity of ways. Such apparent over-production is only another word far a crisis and therefare cannot serve as an explanation of the latter; hence people who try to malte over-production responsible far the present crisis are merely juggling with words. Such apparent over-production is only another word for a crisis, and therefore cannot serve as an explanation of the latter; hence people who try to make over-production responsible for the crisis are merely juggling with words. Such arguments impress me as a kind of mythology; they are not convincing.
Such concepts are not necessarily supposed to correspond to any objects in the outside world. Such cooperation, however, is essential to make human life possible and toler? Such developments manifest themselves in traditions, institutions, and organizations; in literature; in scientific and engineering accomplishments; in works of art. Such disturbing forces produce, indeed, only correspond? Such efforts are, no doubt, greatly needed. Such ethical premises play a similar role in ethics, to that played by axioms in mathematics. Such experiments are easy enough to imagine, but very difficult to perform. Such have been discovered so far: (1) In the revolution of the ellipses of the plane- tary orbits round the sun (confirmed in the case of Mercury).
Such intervals represent elements of possible paths of motion, the velocity being less than that of light.9 In this case the 1-axis may be drawn in the direction of PP' by suitably choosing the state of motion of the inertial system. Such might indeed be the right thing at a time when the physicist believes he has at his disposal a rigid system of fundamental concepts and fundamental laws which are so well established that waves of doubt can not reach them; but, it can not be right at a time when the very foundations of physics itself have become problematic as they are now. Such people are not to be relied on in the hour of crisis, as the World War amply proved. Such pure joy was mine wben I heard about the university courses at Davos.
Such pure joy was mine when I heard about the university courses at Davos. Such reflections kept me busy from 1908 to 1911, and I at- tempted to draw special conclusions from them, of which I do not propose to speak here. Such regions we shall call "Galilean regions." Such service demands not only energy, insight, and a reputation based on solid achievements, but also a freedom from national prejudice and a devotion to the common ends of all, which have become rare in our times. Such service demands not only strength, insigbt, and a reputation based on solid achievements, but also a free? Such strength in itself would make it possible far the partial world government to abandon military secrecy and all the other practices born of insecurity.
Such things serve to test the will to live of our community. Such transformations are called Lorentz transformations. Such treatment destroys the sound sentiments, the sincerity and the self-confidence of L1ie pupil. Such treatment destroys the sound sentiments, the sincerity, and the self-confidence of the pupil. Such was the essence of the difficulty with which we were confronted in Section 23. Such was the point at which fundamental conceptions had arrived at the turn of the century. Such was the position when H. A. Lorentz en- tered the field. Such was the state of things when H. A. Lorentz entered upon the scene. Sucli is tlie stuff of whicli tlie great moral leaders are made who proffer consolation to mankind in their self?
Suddenly the cable supporting the lift breaks, and the lift falls freely toward the ground. Suddenly the sphere begins to "breathe" rhythmically, expanding and contracting in volume, although retaining its spherical shape. Sup- pose the latter to be marked in the heavens. Superficial consideration suggests that the essential parts of Lorentz's theory cannot be reconciled with the relativity principle. Suppose I keep the rubber rod near the metal and at the same time touch the conductor with my finger. Suppose an archaeologist be- longing to a later culture finds a text-book of Eu- clidean geometry without diagrams.
Suppose an observerwho is stationed at the origin of coordinates with the clockassociates a ray of light which comes to him through space, and gives testimony to the event of which the time is to be estimated,with the corresponding position of the hands of the clock. Suppose at two points A and B of the stationary system two clocks are given which are synchronous in the sense explained in 3 when viewed from the stationary system. Suppose now that the quantity A is measured and it is found that it has the value af,. Suppose such a tube is placed before a spectroscope. Suppose that a beam of X-rays falls upon a crystal and, after passing through it, is recorded on a photo- 286 THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS graphic plate.
Suppose that a large space is filled quite uniformly with water, or air, or some other "medium". Suppose that at a definite time t, of K we determine the ends of all the rods. Suppose that at a given time the position and velocity of a planet can be determined, and that the force is known. Suppose that someone going along a level road with a pushcart suddenly stops pushing. Suppose that the action of the force can be repeated as many times as desired, the mechanism of pushing acting in the same way and exerting the same force on the same cart. Suppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of the lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. Suppose that the metal bar consists of two pieces, joined together.
Suppose that we are provided with a great many wooden cubes all of the same size. Suppose that we have isolated a very narrow strip of the spectrum. Suppose that we have radiation of energy E, with frequency between ? Suppose the clock at A to be set in motion in the line joining it with B, then after the arrival of the clock at B, they will no longer be found synchronous, but the clock which was set in motion from A will las: behind the clock v^ which had been all along at B by an amount ^t -g, where t is the time required for the journey. Suppose there are altogether n suspended par- ticles in a liquid. Suppose we draw lines or stretch strings in all directions from a point, and mark off from each of these the distance r with a measuring-rod.
Suppose we have a gram of the lightest of all elements, hydrogen, and ask: how many particles are there in this one gram? Suppose we have a sheet of dark paper with two pinholes through which light may pass. Suppose we have a very thin plate of tourmaline crystal, cut in a particular way which we need not describe here. Suppose we have a voltaic battery and a conducting wire. Suppose we have individualised time and space in any manner; then a world-line parallel to the ^-axis will correspond to a stationar}^ point ; a world-line inclined to the /f-axis will correspond to a point moving uniformly ; and a world-curve will corres- pond to a point moving in any manner.
Suppose we have radiation occupying a volume v. We assume that the observable properties of the radiation are completely determined when the radiation density ? Suppose we have succeeded in carrying out the general relativity programme consistently. Suppose we have, in our simplest case, two c.s., that is, two rigid rods; we draw one above the other and call them respectively the "upper" and "lower" c.s. Suppose we leave, for a while, the question as to whether experiment proved or disproved this theory. Suppose, for example, that the American, English, German, and French Governments insisted on the Japanese Government's putting an immediate stop to their warlike operations in China, under pain of a complete economic boycott.
Suppose, further, that the speeds are equal, that is, both cover the same distance in the same interval of time. Supposing that as a result of ingenious considerations an able meteorologist were to discover that the lightning must always strike the places A and B simultaneously, then we should be faced with the task of testing whether or not this theoretical result is in accordance with the reality. Supreme purity, clarity and certainty at the cost of completeness.
Suspicion against every kind of authority grew out of this expe- rience, a skeptical attitude towards the convictions which were alive in any specific social environment N an atti- tude which has never again left me, even though later on, because of a better insight into the causal connections, it lost some of its original poignancy. Symmetrical Tensors.-A contravariant, or a covariant tensor, of the second or higher rank is said to be symmetrical if two components, which are obtained the one from the other by the interchange of two indices, are equal. Symmetrical tensors : A contravariant or a co-variant tensor of the second or higher rank is called symmetrical when any two com- ponents obtained by the mutual interchange of two indices IXV are equal.

THE FIRST GLUE Attempts to read the great mystery story are as old as human thought itself. THE FIRST SERIOUS DIFFICULTY We are now ready to note the first grave difficulty in the application of our general philosophical point of view. THE FIRST STEP towards language was to link acoustically or otherwise commutable signs to sense-impressions.

THE FOUNDATION OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY. THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY.
THE HUMANITARIAN IDEAL of Europe appears indeed to be unalterably bound up with the free expression of opinion, to some extent with the free-will of the individual, with the effort toward objectivity in thought without consideration of mere utility, and with the encouragement of differences in the realm of mind and taste. THE KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER Is it possible to explain the phenomena of heat in terms of the motions of particles interacting through simple forces? THE MECHANICAL SCAFFOLD On reaching this stage of our story, we must turn back to the beginning, to Galileo's law of inertia. THE MECHANICS OF NEWTON AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS It is just two hundred years ago that Newton closed his eyes.
THE NEED FOR ETHICAL CULTURE 53 THE NEED FOR ETIDCAL CULTURE Letter read on the occasion of the seventy-fitt h anniversary of the Ethical Culture Society, N ew York, ]anuary, 1951. THE PARTICLE PROBLEM IN GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY. THE PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUND The results of scientific research very often force a change in the philosophical view of problems which extend far beyond the restricted domain of science it- self. THE PROBLEM OF SPACE 73 The structure of such a space differs absolutely radically in one respect from that of a Euclidean space. THE PROBLEM OF SPACE, ETHER, AND THE FIELD IN PHYSICS Scientific thought is a development of pre-scientific thought.
THE PRODUCT OF THE FIELD-VECTORS /'f 51 Now upon the basis of the equations (55) and (56), and referring back to the expression (8) for L, and from 57) we obtain the following- expressions as components of N, dt OXh ^ OX,, for h= l, 2, 3,4. THE RATE OF EXCHANGE Less than a hundred years ago the new clue which led to the concept of heat as a form of energy was guessed by Mayer and confirmed experimentally by Joule. THE REALITY OF THE FIELD The quantitative, mathematical description of the laws of the field is summed up in what are called Maxwell's equations. THE RELEASE OF ATOMIC ENERGY has not created a new problem. THE RIDDLE OF COLOUR It was again Newton's genius which explained for the first time the wealth of colour in the world.
THE RIDDLE OF MOTION So long as we deal only with motion along a straight line, we are far from understanding the motions ob- served in nature. THE SWITCHBACK Let us trace the motion of that popular thrill-giver, the switchback. THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY MATHEMATICS DEALS exclusively with the relations of concepts to each other without consideration of their relation to experience. THE THEORY OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY. THE TWO PILLARS OF THE FIELD THEORY "The change of an electric field is accompanied by a magnetic field." THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT In Galileo's Two New Sciences we listen to a conversation of the master and his pupils about the velocity of light: SAGREDO: But of what kind and how great must we consider this speed of light to be?
THE WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT Let us recall why we broke off the description of optical phenomena. THE WAVES OF MATTER How can we understand the fact that only certain characteristic wave-lengths appear in the spectra of the elements? THE WORLD AS I SEE IT Originally published in Forum and Century, Voi. THE special theory of relativity is based on the following postulate, which is also satisfied by the mechanics of Galileo and Newton. THEFOLLOWING DERIVATION of the law of equivalence, which has not been published before, has two advantages. THEORY OF THE DIFFUSION OF SMALL SPHERES IN SUSPENSION Suppose there be suspended particles irregularly dispersed in a liquid. THEORY OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD.

THOUGHTS ON THE WORLD ECONOMIC CRISIS 87 I have daily occasion for observing that the greatest obstacle whicb the work of our commission has to encounter is the lack of confidence in its political impartiality. THOUGHTS ON THE WORLD ECONOMIC CRISIS Thisand the following two articles were written d uring the world economie crisis of the 1930's.

Take a yardstick; this means that a stick is a yard in length as long as it is at rest in a c.s. Take as an example not one, but two fixed points on the upper rod and consider the distance between them. Take short waves on a river impinging on the side of a large ship. Take the simplest ex- ample of two pieces of wood rubbed one against the other. Take two bodies, the Sun and the Earth, for instance. Take two vessels containing equal volumes of different gases, say hydrogen and nitrogen, both at the same tempera- ture.
Take, for example, the fact that light rays travel in vacuo or in air along straight lines. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. Taken together with the terrify? Taking into consideration the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light we find that and 0 r where rAB denotes the length of the moving rodNmeasured in the stationary system. Taking into consideration the principle of^ A constancy of the velocity of light, we have and t - B b PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY where r is the lens^th of the movins^ rod, measured in the stationary system. Taking the interval between the beginning and the end of such an event as one unit of time, arbitrary time intervals may be measured by repetition of this physical process.
Taking the ordinary point of view we now inquire as to the OlongitudinalO and the OtransverseO mass of the moving electron. Tbat a man can take pleasure in marcbing in fours to the strains of a band is enougb to make me despise him. Tbe case of the ordinary theory of relativity arises out of the case bere considered, if it is possible, by reason of the particular relations of the g ,,..,.

Teachers and Pupils An address to children (The principal art of the teacher is to awaken the joy in creation and knowledge.) Teaching alone cannot do that. Teaching on a large scale will only become important later on. Teaching should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not as a hard duty. Technically, when speaking of curves, we include straight lines. Techniques of investigation, systematic methods of find- ing and following clues, have been developed. Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all.
Technology has also shortened distances and created new and extraordinarily effective means of destruction which, in the hands of nations claiming unrestricted freedom of action, become threats to the security and very survival of mankind. Ten years later, Einstein formulated his second theory, the Generalised Principle of Relativity. Ten years later, in 1905, we find Einstein declarinsj that " the ether will be proved to be superflous." Tensor are called metrical or skew-symmetrical in respect to two of their indices, and ?, if both the components which result from interchanging the indices and ? Tensors may be formed by contraction with respect to two indices of different character, for example, A??
Tensors may be formed by multiplication, keeping the character of the indices, just as in the theory of invariants of linear orthogonal transformations, for example, A B? Tensors of higher rank (number of indices) may be defined analytically. Tensors of the Second and Higher Ranks Gontravariant Tensors .-If we form all the sixteen pro? Tensors of the second and highei ranks. Tensors of the third and higher ranks may be defined in an analogous way. Tentatively accepted theories have explained many of the facts, but no general solution compatible with all known clues has yet been evolved. Testing these predictions is intricate and still under investigation, but so far, experiments confirm the general relativity conclusions.
Tests which are capable of pronounc- ing a verdict of life or death on a theory occur fre- quently in the history of physics, and are called crucial experiments. Th1s government should be founded by the United States, t?e Soviet Union and Great Britain, the only three powers with great military strength. Thanks to America Mr. Mayor, Ladies, and Gentlemen, The splendid reception which you have accorded to me to-day puts me to the blush in so far as it is meant for me personally, but it gives me all the more pleasure in so far as it is meant for me as a representative of pure science. Thanks to the generosity of the University of Leiden, I frc.. quently spent some time there staying with my dear and unfar?
Thanks to the untiring energy and splendid self-sacrificing spirit of the Jewish doctors in America, we have succeeded in collecting enough money for the creation of a medical faculty, and the preliminary work isbeing started at once. Thanks to this newly aroused feeling of solidarity among the Jews, the colonization of Palestine which our devoted and far sighted leaders have already brought well under way, despite apparently unconquerable difficulties has achieved such excel lent results that I have no doubt as to its permanent success. That Euclidean geometry, from this point of view, affirms something more than the mere deductions derived logically from definitions may be seen from the following simple consideration.
That a man can take pleasure in marching in formation to the strains of a band is enough to make me despise him. That a mechanical system is permanently susceptible only of discrete energy-values or states as experience so to speak directly shows seems at first sight hardly deducible from a field-theory which operates with differential equations. That being so, it is for us to solve the problem of living side by side with our brother the Arab in an open, generous, and worthy manner. That cannot be of advantage in the pur?
That generalization of metric, which had already been accomplished in the sphere of pure mathematics through the researches of Gauss and Riemann, is essentially based on the fact that the metric of the special theory of relativity can still claim validity for small areas in the general case as well. That is a difficult question and no single answer will cover it. That is essentially what is being attempted in Russia today. That is not altogetber easy far me. That is not altogether easy for me. That is not an attempt to say when it will come, but only that 1t IS sure to come. That is the essence of all true tolerance; without tolerance in this widest sense there can be no question of true morality. That is the weakness of the pacifist movement.
That is to interfere in counb"ies where a minority is oppress? That is to say, if light travels with a speed of one mile per second, then two seconds will elapse between .4's sending and receiving a signal, assuming that B is a mile away. That is to say, the State should be our servant and not we its slaves. That is to say: If we substitute their expressions in x, y, x, t, in place of x', y', x', t', on the left-hand side, then the left-hand side of (11a) agrees with the righthand side. That is what we wish to express when we say that space is infinite.
That is why Hume's clear message seemed crushing: The sensory raw material, the only source of our knowledge, through habit may lead us to belief and expectation but not to the knowledge and still less to the understanding of law-abiding relations. That is why Hume's clear message seemed crushing: the sensory raw materia], the only source of our knowledge, through habit may lead us to belief and expectation but not to the knowledge and still less to the understanding of lawful relations. That is why I began by telling you that the fate of the human race was more than ever dependent on its moral strength to-day. That is why relatively insignificant, constantly operative causes are able to exert a considerable influence on the dis- tribution of velocities over the cross section.
That is why the Disarmament Conference of 1932 will decide the fate of this generation and the next. That is why this Congress has such a vital mission. That is, by the afore-mentioned choice of " coordinates," (11a) is transformed into this equation. That is, if the United States had dispersed its indus? That is, if this being is omnip?

That is, the signal starting from A Avill reach 15 (as observed in system S') in less than no time. That is, we can look upon the effects of a gravitational field as simply due to the local properties of space and time itself.
That is: does it reduce to the familiar concept if the curve becomes a straight line? That light requires the same time to traverse the path A M as for the path B M is in reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the physical nature of light, but a stipulation which I can make of my own freewill in order to arrive at a definition of simultaneity." That may be no military drawback so long as the United States has the exclusive use of the bomb. That may be true for eras of primitive techical development, where the production of the neces?

That primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground thet the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsacker, te attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the Anorican work on uranium is now being repeated. That something" he takes to be relation to absolute space. That term is necessary only for the purpose of making possible a quasi-static distribution of mattar, as required by the fa.et of the ama.Il velocities of the stars.
That the Russians are striving to prevent the formation of a supranational security system is no reason why the rest of the world should not work to create one. That the axiom had to be accepted unproved did not disturb me. That the equations (52) and (53) correspond, to a first approximation, to the hydrodynamical equations of classical mechanics, is a further confirmation of the generalized energy principle. That the quantity of heat capable of increasing the temperature of a pound of water (weighed in vacuo and taken at between 55 and 60) by i Fahr. That the special theory of relativ- ity is only the first step of a necessary development became completely clear to me only in my efforts to represent gravitation in the framework of this theory.
That the study of Brownian motion can lead to a deter- mination of the mass of a molecule is therefore not astonishing. That there are bodily objects to which we have to ascribe, within a certain sphere of perception, no alteration of state, but only alterations of position, is a fact of fundamental im? That there are, nevertheless, in the general case, invariant differential operations for tensors, is recognized most satisfactorily in the following way, introduced by Levi-Civita and Weyl. That these two radically dillerent defi? That this gives the right conception of energy and the conservation principles will be seen from the following considerations. That this may actually be the case can best be shown by an example.
That this needle behaved in such a determined way did not at all fit into the nature of events which could find a place in the unconscious world of concepts (effect connected with direct "touch"). That this object may actually be attained by an extension of the principle of relativity, follows from the following consideration. That this requirement of general co-variance, which takes away .from space and time the last remnant of physical objectivity, is a natural one, will be seen from the following re:fl.exion. That was true before the atomic bomb was made.
That we have not been accustomed to regard the world in this sense as a four-dimensional continuum is due to the fact that in physics, before the advent of the theory of relativity, time played a different and more independent role, as compared with the space coordinates. That which determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the inertial mass of the body." That which gives the "mollusc" a certain comprehensibility as compared with the Gauss co-ordinate system is the (really unjustified) formal retention of the separate existence of the space co-ordinates as opposed to the time co-ordinate. That which gives them substance is not relevant to mathematics.
That will help dispel the distrust of the Russians, which they already feel because the bomb is being kept a secret chieHy to prevent their having it. That would be a possible way, if tbe value of tbe gravitational potential were not itself necessarily conditioned by the heavenly bodies. That, in essentials, is what is being attempted in Russia to-day. That, of course, means short hours and high wages, and not, as is so often advocated, longer hours and lower wages. That, to my mind, is a main cause for the barbarization of politica!ways in our time. The " Curl " of a covariant Vector.-The second term in (26) is symmetrical in the indices and v.

The (positive ) number S means the Iength of the stretch, or the distance between the two points P' and P" of space (which are coincident with the points P' and P" of the stretch).

The 1923 English translation modified the notation used in EinsteinOs 1905 paper to conform to that in use by the 1920Os; for example, c denotes the speed of light, as opposed the V used by Einstein in 1905.

The 94 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY raecbapica] behaviour of the bodies relative to K' is the i^me as experience would expect of them with reference to systems which we assume from habit as stationary; thus it explains why from the physical stand-point it can be assumed that the systems K and K' can both with the same legitimacy be taken as at rest, that is, they will be equivalent as systems of reference for a description of physical phenomena. The :field theory, so far, has failed in the molecular sphere.

The Academy took cognizance of your resignation in its plenary session of March 30, 1933.
The Academy's Answer of April 11, 1933 The Academy would like to point out that its statement of April 1, 1933. was based not merely on German but principally on foreign, particularly French and Belgian, newspaper reports which Herr Einstein has not contradicted; in addition, it had before it his much-canvassed statement to the League for combating anti-Semitism, in which he deplores Germany's relapse into the barbarism of long-passed ages.

The Assembly, inview of these high tasks, should not delegate its powers to the Security Council, especially while that body is paralyzed by the shortcomings of the veto provisions. The Bavarian Academy of Sciences, which some years ago elected you a corresponding member, is also a German Academy, closely allied to the Prussian and other German Academies; hence your withdrawal from the Prussian Acadeiny of Sciences is bound to affect your relations with our Academy. The Behaviour of Measuring-Rods and Clocks in Motion Place a metre-rod in the x1-axis of K1 in such a manner that one end (the beginning) coincides with the point x1=0 whilst the other end (the end of the rod) coincides with the point x1=I.

The Commission has invariably failed to give moral support to those individuals and associations who have thrown themselves without reserve into the business of working for an international order and against the military system. The Commission has never made any attempt to resist the appointment of members whom it knew to stand for tendencies the very reverse of those it is bound in duty to foster. The Commission seems to me even worse in this respect than the League taken as a whole.

The Flettner ship is closely akin to the sailing ship in the way it works ; as in the latter, the force of the wind is the only motive-power for propelling the ship, but instead of sails, the wind acts on vertical sheet-metal cylinders, which are kept rotating by small motors. The Flettner ship, which is just now filling the whole world with amazement, is an excellent example of this commonplace and, for us, far from flattering truth.

The Galilean relativity principle is valid for mechanical phenomena. The Galilei transformation can be obtained from the Lorentz transformation by substituting an infinitely large value for the velocity of light c in the latter transformation.
The Galileian System of Co-ordinates As is well known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of Galilei-Newton, which is known as the law of inertia, can be stated thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. The Gauss co-ordinate system has to take the place of the body of reference. The Gaussian coordinate system is a logical generalisation of the Cartesian co-ordinate system. The General Form of the Field Equations of Gravitation.
The General Principle of Relativity asserts that all motion is merely relative motion between matter and matter, and as all movements must be referred to definite sets of co-ordinates, the ground of any possible framework must ultimately be material in character, it /v convenient to take the matter actually present in a field as the fundamental ground of our framework. The General Theory of Relativity. The Generalised Principle of Relativity [A. Einstein's second paper on the Genera- lised Principle first published in 1916. The German Press has reproduced a deliberately distorted version of my words, as indeed was only to be expected with the Press muzzled as it is to-day. The German text was published in the Berliner Tageblatt, N ovember 11, 1930.
The Hamiltonian Function for the Gravitational Field. The Heirs of the Ages Previous generations were able to look upon intellectual and cultural progress as simply the inherited fruits of their forebears' labours, which made life easier and more beautiful for them. The Hertz theory suffered not only from the defect of ascribing to matter and ether, on the one hand mechanical states, and on the other hand electrical states, which do not stand in any conceivable relation to each other; it was also at variance with the result of Fizeaus important experiment on the velocity of the propagation of light in moving fluids, and with other established experimental results. The Hertzian^ forms must be given up, for it has appeared that they are contrary to many experi- mental results.
The Heuristic Value of the Theory of Relativity. The Impulse-energy law for matter as a consequence of the field-equations. The Institute for Intellectual Co-operation During this year the leading politicians of Europe have for the first time drawn the logical conclusion from the truth that our portion of the globe can only regain its prosperity if the underground struggle between the traditional political units ceases. The Intemational Association of Academies was broken up. The International of Science At a sitting of the Academy during the War, at the time when national and political infatuation had reached its height, Emil Fischer spoke the following emphatic words: "It's no use, Gentlemen, science is and remains international."
The Jewish Community A speech in London Ladies and Gentlemen, It is no easy matter for me to overcome my natural inclination to a life of quiet contemplation. The Jewish people free of petty chauvinism and of the evils of European nationalism, living peacefully side by side with the Arabs, who enjoy equal rights should be enabled to lead its national life in its ancient homeland, so that it may again assume a dominant r 61 e in the civilization of the world. The Jewish people will have to provide funds for this constructive work for many years to come.

The Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of fear to moral religion, which is continued in the New Testament. The Jewish sense of the sanctity of life could not be more simply expressed. The Jews are a community bound together by ties of blood and tradition, and not of religion only: the attitude of the rest of the world towards them is sufficient proof of this.

The Liberty of Doctrine propos of the Guntbel Case Academic chairs are many, but wise and noble teachers are few; lecture-rooms are numerous and large, but the number of young people who genuinely thirst after truth and justice is small. The Lorentz assumption of polarisation doublets had furnished a satisfactory explana- tion of the Fresnelian convection of ether, but in the new theory this is deduced merely as a consequence of the altered concept of relative velocity. The Lorentz transformation represented by (8) and (9) still requires to be generalised.
The Mathematical auxiliaries developed under ^ B ' at once enables us to generalise, according to the generalised theory of relativity, the physical laws of matter (Hydrody- namics, Maxwell's Electro-dynamics) as they lie already formulated ^ according to the special-relativit^'-theorA'. The Maxwell electromagnetic field, as is well known, is represented by the antisymmetric field tensor p~(= Brp/Bx" Brp/Bx &), which satis- fies the field equations These equations have the well-known conse- quence that the divergence of the tensor T'k gg 'k(P PP Pia Pk vanishes.

The Maxwell-Lorentz theory of the electro-mag- netic field served as the ;iiodel for the space-time theory and the kinematics of the special theory of relativity. The Michelson and Morley interference experiment showed that, in a special case, second-order terms also cannot be detected, although they were expected from the standpoint of the ether-at-rest theory.
The Michelson-Morley experiment seems to show that there is no relative motion of ether and matter. The Need for an Extenson of the Postulate of Relatlvity. The Newtonian Theory It is well known that Newton's limiting condition of the constant limit for </> at spatial infmity leads to the view that tbe density of matter becomes zero at infinity.

The Prussian Academy of Sciences heard with indignation from the newspapers of Albert Einstein's participation in atrocity-mongering in France and America. The Prussian Academy of Sciences is particularly distressed by Einstein's activities as an agitator in foreign countries, as it and its members have always felt themselves bound by the closest ties to the Prussian State and, while abstaining strictly from all political partisanship, have alwa58 stressed and remained faithful to the national idea. The Question of Disarmament The greatest obstacle to the success of the disarmament plan was the fact that people in general left out of account the chief difficulties of the problem. The Relation of the Four Co-ordinates to Measurement in Space and Time. The Relativity of Simulatneity.
The Religiousness of Science You will hardly find one among the profounder sort of scientific minds without a peculiar religious feeling of his own. The Riemann-Christoffel Tensor. The Row- land effect proportional to K, together with the opposite Rontgen effect proportional to 1 K, makes the Eichenwald effect independent of K. All these experiments together with those of Blondlot and Wilson made it clear that the electromagnetic effect due to a moving dielectric was proportional to K 1, and not to K as required by Hertz's theory. The Russians have made it clear that they will do everything in their power to prevent a supranational regime from coming into existence.
The Russians may be partly right about the dillculty of retaining their present social structure in a supranational regime, though in time they may be brought to see that this is a far lesser loss than remaining isolated from a world of law. The Schrodinger equation determines the time variations which are experienced by the ensemble of systems which may exist with or without external action on the single system. The Solution of the Problem of Gravitation on the Basis of the General Principle of Relativity.
The Soviet government is determined to maintain its present social structure, and the leaders of Russia, who hold their great power through the nature of that structure, will spare no effort to prevent a supranational regime from coming into existence, to control atomic energy or anything else.

The State transgresses this commandment when it compels us by force to engage in military and war service, the more so since the object and the effect of this slavish service is to kill people belonging to other countries or interfere with their freedom of development.

The UN as it stands today has neither the military force nor the legai basis t bring about a state of intemational security. The UN cannot be blamed for these failures. The UN now and world government eventually must serve one single goal-the guarantee of the security, tranquillity, and the welfare of all mankind. The United Nations Organization is now in the process of being tested. The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities.

The aban- donment of a certain concept connected with space, time and motion hitherto treated as fundamentals must not be regarded as arbitrary, but only as con- ditioned by observed facts. The above experiment suggests another. The above mentioned equations are transformed into ,/___,,._ ,.' The above paradox may then be formulated as follows. The above theory of Relativity absorbed practically the whole of the electromagnetic theory based on the * See Notes 9 and 12. The above-named bodies can now begin to function. The absolute character of time and particularly of simultaneity were destroyed, and the four dimensionai description became introduced as the only adequate one.
The abstract concept "society" means to the individual human being the sum total of his direct and indirect relations to his contemporaries and to all the people of earlier generations. The abstract concept '"society" means to the individual. The acceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction of the floor of the chest. The accomplishment of such a far-reaching change in the life of nations presupposes a mighty moral effort, a deliberate departure from deeply ingrained tradition. The account will be boring not only because the description of experiments is un- interesting in comparison with their actual performance, but also because the meaning of the experiments does not become apparent until theory makes it so.
The accumulated resentment of the war period has not yet died down, and many influential men persist in the irreconcilable attitude into which they allowed themselves to be driven by the pressure of circumstances. The achievement of socialism requires the solu? The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power, to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? The action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly. The active forces are Newton's gravitational forces depending on the distance alone.
The advantage of this method will be, as I expresslj' emphasize here, that we shall have to handle symbols which have apparently a purely real appearance ; we can however at any moment pass to real equations if it is understood that of the symlbols with indices, such ones as have the suffix 4 only once, denote imaginary quantities, while those NOTATIONS which have not at all the suffix 4, or have it twice denote real quantities. The advantages of the constructive theory are com- pleteness, adaptability and clearness, those of the principle theory are logical perfection and security of the foundations.
The agreement between Holland and Belgium, which is the only bright spot in European affairs during the last few years, encourages one to hope that the small nations will play a leading part in the attempt to liberate the world from the degrading yoke of militarism through the renunciation of the individual country's unlimited right of self-determination. The agreement of these con- siderations with experience together with Planck's determination of the true molecular size from the law of radiation (for high temperatures) convinced the skeptics, who were quite numerous at that time (Ost- wald, Mach), of the reality of atoms. The aim of every theory is to guide us to new facts, sug- gest new experiments, and lead to the discovery of new phenomena and new laws.
The aim of science is, on the one hand, a comprehension, as complete as possible, of the connection between the sense experiences in their totality, a.Ild, on the other hand, the ac? The aim of the theory is to determine the probability of the results of measurement upon a system at a given time. The amazing thing is the apparently eternal character of the motion. The amount of energy going STr{c cos ^v) away from unit surface of the mirror per unit of time is A'"V?7r {c cos ^"+v). The amount of money in a safe will remain unchanged so long as the safe remains locked, and so will the amounts of mass and heat in an isolated body. The analogy between light waves and electronic waves or photons and electrons is one clue.
The analogy holds with Omagnetomotive forces.O We see that electromotive force plays in the developed theory merely the part of an auxiliary concept, that when8If, for example, X=Y=Z=L=M=0, and Nv changes sign without changing its numerical value, Y= 06 , then from reasons of symmetry it is clear0 must also change sign without changing its numerical value. The ancient Greeks also had slaves. The answer given by Coulomb's experiment is that this dependence on dis- tance is the same as in Newton's law of gravitation and Coulomb's law of electrostatics. The answer given by experiment is quite clear. The answer is a fantastically small number : o-ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo 0033 gram, representing the mass of one molecule of hydrogen.
The answer is an astonishingly great number: a three followed by twenty-three other digits ! The answer is in the negative ; for the above-mentioned relation of freely movable masses to K' may be interpreted equally well in the following way. The answer is simple enough: so long as none of the energy is given off ex? The answer lies in Galileo's old experiment in which he dropped different masses from a tower. The answer of modern physics is just the opposite: the identity of the two masses is fundamental and forms a new and essential clue lead- ing to a more profound understanding. The answer to that was found in the study of heat phe? The answer to this fundamental question was found by Galileo and still more concisely by Newton, and forms a further clue in our investigation.
The answer will be understood if two c.s. The answer will characterize not only hydrogen but also all other gases, for we already know under what conditions two gases have the same number of particles. The answer, from the point of view of classical physics, is : the identity of the two masses is accidental and no deeper significance should be attached to it. The answers to tl1ese questions have, for centuries, given rise 50 lDEAS AND OPINIONS to considerable dispute and, indeed, bitter fighting. The antipathy of these scholars to- wards atomic theory can indubitably be traced back to their positivistic philosophical attitude.
The antithesis of ether and matter would then fade away, and the whole of physics would become a com- RELATIVITY AND THE ETHER III pletely enclosed intellectual system, like geometry, kinematics and the theory of gravitation, through the general theory of relativity. The anxious care with which the United States keep out foreign goods by means of prohibitive tariffs certainly contrasts oddly with this notion.&hellip;But an innocent visitor must not be expected to rack his brains too much, and, when all is said and done, it is not absolutely certain that every question admits of a rational answer. The apparatus was now rotated through 90, so that OB became the up-stream.
The appearance of a discontinu- ous set of definite wave-lengths is characteristic of the atomic phenomena in which the existence of element- ary quanta is revealed. The appearance of rings is very characteristic of a wave theory. The appearance of such great amounts of energy in molecular entities under the influence of a light source in which the energy is distributed so thinly (as we must assume for light radiation and X-rays, given the oscillation theory) drove competent physicists to take refuge in a rather far-out hypothesis. The appearance of the crisis in America shows that they cannot be its principal causes.
The application of Newtons mechanics to continuously distributed masses led inevitably to the discovery and applica- tion of partial differential equations, which in their turn first provided the language for the laws of the field-theory. The application of this general theory of relativity was found to be in conflict with a well-known experiment, according to which it appeared that the weight and the inertia of a body depended on the same constants ( identity of inert and heavy masses ). The apposite extreme is illustrateci by over-populated China or India, where the low price of labor has stood in the way of the development of machinery. The area they present to the wind is some ten times smaller than that of the equivalent tackle of a sailing ship.
The argument becomes even more interesting if we choose a plate that completely reflects only frequencies between and + d, and is transparent to all other radiation. The armament industry is, as you say, one of the greatest dangers that beset mankind. The arrangement is such, that each side of a square belongs to two squares and each corner to four squares. The arrow of the force vector and the arrows on the line of force point in the same direction. The arrow on each line shows that the force is directed toward the sun; this means the force is an attraction. The artificial character of all these assumptions, the necessity for introducing so many of them all quite independent of each other, was enough to shatter the belief in the mechanical point of view.
The aspiration toward such objective knowledge belongs to the 42 IDE.A.S AND OPINIONS highest of which man is capab!e, and you will certainly not suspect me of wishing to belittle the achievements and the heroic efforts of man in this sphere. The assertion that events abroad force us to arm is wrong, we must combat it with all our strength. The association of solved problems with those unsolved may throw new light on our difficulties by suggesting new ideas.
The assumption of the complete physical equivalence of the systems of coordinates, K and K', we call the "principle of equivalence;" this principle is evidently intimately connected with the law of the equality between the inert and the gravitational mass, and signifies an extension of the principle of relativity to co-ordinate systems which are in non-uniform motion relatively to each other. The assumption seems to us to be all the more legitimate, as (46) contains only the first differentials of (/ , among which there is no relation in the special ease when Kq exists. The assumption th.at space was filled with a medium consisting of materia!points that propagated light waves without exhibiting any other mechanical proper?
The assumption that all the corpuscles of light have exactly the same velocity in empty space also seems very artificial. The assumption that the T, do not depend on tbe derivatives of the gv is in keeping with the historical development of these equations. The assumption that this velocity of propagation is dependent on the direction "in space" is in itself improbable. The astonishing result of his experiment is that the potential difference between the copper and zinc plates does not vanish as in the case of two charged conduc- tors connected by a wire. The atom is a rich miser who, during his life, crease of e in the mass. The atom is richer in energy before the emission and poorer afterwards.
The atoms of every element are composed of elementary particles, the heavier constituting the nucleus, and the lighter the electrons. The attempt to combine wisdom and power has only rarely been successful and tlien only far a short while. The attitude of the individua! The attraction between iron and magnet follows^If the magnet is removed, the fluids go back to more or less their original state, depending on the extent to which they remember the commanding voice of the external force. The attribution of energy to the field is one step farther in the development in which the field concept was stressed more and more, and the concepts of substances, so essential to the mechanical point of view, were more and more suppressed.
The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated. The average value of 2 is given by the expression <2> = (1/c) d A dt First of all, the simplicity of this expression is noteworthy. The awakening of these productive psycbological powers is certainly Iess easy than the practice of force or the awaken?

The awareness of this strange state of affairs would be unbear?
The axiom denotes that in a world-point the expression ciflfi dx"^ fh^ dz"^ shall always be positive or what is eipiivalent to the same thing, every velocity V should be snialler than c, c shall therefore be the up[)er limit for all substantial velocities and herein lies a deep significance for tlie 76 PJliNClPLE Oi^ KELATlVlTV quantity c. At the first impression, the axiom seems to be rather unsatisfactory. The background for all events was no longer the one-dimensional time and the three-dimensional space continuum, but the four-dimensional time-space continuum, another free invention, with new transfor- mation properties. The balance of the time I used in the main in order to study at home the works of Kirchhoff, Helmholtz, Hertz, etc.
The basal principle, which was the pivot of all our previous considerations, was the special principle of relativity, i.e. The basic concepts and laws which are not logically further reducibleconstitutethe indispensableandnot rationallydeducible part of the theory. The basic space-structure is thereby completely de- fined. The basis of all scientific work is the conviction that the world is an ordered and comprehensive entity, which is a religious sentiment. The basis of the theory became still more unsatisfactory wben electrodynamic pbe? The beam which comes through will consist of homogeneous light, that is, light which cannot be split into further components.
The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear at an early stage of development, e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear in earlier stages of development e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. The behaviour of the big particles reflects in some way that of the molecules, constituting, so to speak, a magnification so high that it becomes visible through the microscope.
The belief, prevailing among the physicists of today, that such an attempt would be hopeless, may bave its root in the unjustifiable idea that such a theory should lead, as a fust approximation, to the equations of classica!mechanics for the motion of corpuscles, or at least to total differential equations. The bending of light around small obstacles and the explanation of refraction are the strongest arguments in its favour. The best in man can flourish only when he loses himself in a community. The best of the Jewish people, especially the Prophets and Jesus, contended tirelessly for this. The best way to serve the cause of intemationalism is by cooperating in some life-giving work. The best way to serve the cause of internationalism is by co-operating in some life-giving work.
The bitter and the sweet come from the outside, the hard from within, from one's own efforts. The bombing of civilian centers was initi? The book is a simple chat between you and us. The bound electrons are also to participate in conservative interactions with the free molecules and electrons when the latter come 2 very close. The burden of my request is that you should please advise Signor Mussolini to spare the flower of Italy's intellect this humiliation. The calculation gives for the planet Mercury, a rotation of path of amount 43" per century, corresponding suflii- ciently to what has been found by astronomers (Leverrier). The car is to run up and down, with its starting-point, say, at one hundred feet above ground level.
The career of electromagnetic processes in vacuo appears to be completely determined by these equations, uninfluenced by other physical quantities. The cart moves along a perfectly smooth and horizontal plane after the push. The cart will go on moving for a short distance before coming to rest. The case of the observer in our lift is, however, different. The case that we have been considering is analogous to that which is presented in the twodimensional treatment of surfaces. The causai and objective mode of thinking-though not neces? The cause must thus lie outside the system. The cause of this may well be the desire, unattainable far many, to understand the few ideas to whch I IO IDEAS AND OPINIONS bave with my feeble powers attained througb ceaseless struggle.
The cause of this may well be the desire, unattainable for many, to understand the one or two ideas to which I have with my feeble powers attained through ceaseless struggle. The cavity contains an energy density d for frequencies between and + d. Finding as a function of and T poses a problem. The centrifugal forces which manifest themselves in relation to this system must, according to Newtons teaching, be regarded as effects of inertia. The chances are very good that the experiment will confirm our expectation. The change in direction took place during the time interval in which the velocities of the two walkers were different. The change in momentum, Ix, Iy, Iz, and the change in energy, E, are then given by the expressions Ix = oll01 dl ok dxdydzx = 1i o K dx dx dx dx1 1 2 3 4 .
The character of symmetry or skew-symmetry exists independently of the choice of co-ordinates, and in this lies its importance. The character of the force acting upon the positive magnetic pole can be read from our drawing. The characteristic feature of this motion is : only the two end-points are at rest. The characteristic features of Maxwell's equations, appearing in all other equations of modern physics, are summarized in one sentence. The chest together with the observer then begin to move "upwards" with a uniformly accelerated motion. The chief object of your attack against me concerns my support of "world government."
The chief question which still remains to be investigated is this: To what extent can physical fields and primary entities be represented by solu- tions, free from singularities, of the equations which answer the former question? The choice between these two representations is merely a matter of taste, for they are, in fact, equivalent. The circle must be broken somewhere. The circulation will therefore only achieve its maxi- mum extent behind the position of the greatest curva- ture, and the same naturally applies to the asymmetry of the erosion.
The circumstance that there is no objective rational division of the four-dimensional continuum into a three-dimensional space and a one-dimensional time continuum indicates that the laws of nature will assume a form which is logically most satisfactory when expressed as laws in the four-dimensional space-time continuum. The classical physicist would answer: Nothing; they still have the same rhythm, and we can use moving as well as resting clocks to indicate time. The classical theory as a limiting case. The classical transformation seems too obvious and simple for any attempt to change it. The clear conception of the differential law is one of Newtons greatest intellectual achievements. The clear realization of this reveals both Newtons wisdom and also a weak side to his theory.
The clocks are all at rest relative to the c.s. The clue originating in the phe- nomenon of Brownian movement was one of those which led to the quantitative data. The clue to an explanation of motion along a straight line was simple : external force is responsible for change in velocity; the force vector has the same direction as the change. The co-efficients (g/iv) of this metric at the same time describe the gravitational field with reference to the co-ordinate system selected. The co-ordinate of a point in the lower c.s. The co-ordinates chosen are convenient when it is a question of examining the environment of one of the two joints g1 = g2 = Ea = O. The co-ordinates of the lattice points of this frame are integral numbers.
The co-variance of the equation of continuity, (17) requires, from the foregoing, no particular discussion. The co-variant and contra-variant tensors can be looked upon as special cases of mixed tensors. The co-variant fundamental tensorIn the invariant expression of the square of the linear element ds^-=ig dx dx 112 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY (U plays the role of any arbitarily chosen eontravariant vector, since further g q , it follows from the eonsi- [XV '^ VfX derations of the last paragraph that g is a symmetrical co-variant tensor of the second rank. The coefficients Cr of our first example are really altered very little under the action of the external force.
The coefficients g/nv are for the time being any functions whatever of the co-ordinates xi to X4, and the structure of the space is not really determined until these functions g/xv are really known. The combined system of gravitational and electro- magnetic equations are treated similarly and lead to a similar interpretation. The community in Palestine must approach the social ideal of our forefathers as it is laid down in the Bible, and at the same time become a seat of modern intellectual life, a spiritual centre for the Jews of the whole world. The community or State was no fetish to him; he based its right to demand sacrifices of the individual entirely on its duty to give the individual personality a chance of harmonious development.
The community or state was no fetish 6B IDEAS ANO OPINIL\NS to him; he based its right to demand sacrifices of the individua! The comparison is false and will have to be abandoned later, but it has a modicum of justification which may be extended and modified to make it more appropriate to the endeavour of science to solve the mystery of the universe. The compensatory effect of the Fresnelian convection of ether afforded a satisfactory explanation of all neo^ative results. The con- clusion is: if the same force acts on two different bodies, both initially at rest, the resulting velocities will not be the same.
The concept "true" does not tally with the assertions of pure geometry, because by the word "true" we are eventually in the habit of designating always the correspondence with a "real" object; geometry, however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of these ideas among themselves. The concept arose from the effort of push- ing, throwing or pulling from the muscular sensation accompanying each of these acts. The concept does not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility of discovering whether or not it is fulfilled in an actual case.
The concept of "truth" can not yet be applied to such a structure; to my thinking this concept can come in question only when a far-reach- ing agreement (convention) con- cerning the elements and rules of the game is already at hand. The concept of a plane wave, like many other physical concepts, is no more than a fiction which can be realized with only a certain degree of accuracy. The concept of field can now be put to a much more severe test. The concept of field reveals its importance by leading to new experimental facts. The concept of space is, it is true, useful, but not indis? The concept of this distance is physically significant because the distance can be measured directly by means of a rigid measuring rod.
The concept, "acceleration relative to space," then loses every meaning and with it the principle of inertia together with the entire para- dox of Mach. The conception of physical bodies, in particular of rigid bodies, is a relatively constant complex of such sense perceptions. The conception sketched above corresponds, a priori, to the atomistic structure of matter insof ar as the ''bridge" is by its nature a discrete element. The conception was so radically different from all accepted theories that in spite of the great success of Planck's radiation formula in explaining the observed facts of black-body radiation, it did not meet with much favour from the physicists.
The conceptionhere outlined of the purely fictitious character of the basic principlesof theory was in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuriesstill far from being the prevailingone. The concepts of a tree, a horse, any material body, are creations gained on the basis of experience, though the impressions from which they arise are primitive in comparison with the world of physical phenomena. The concepts of classical mechanics afford no way of expressing this. The concepts of mass, acceleration, and force and the laws connecting them, appeared to be directly borrowed from experience. The concepts of mass, inertia and force, and the laws connecting them seemed to be drawn directly from experience. The concepts of the pure numbers 2, 3, 4, .
The concepts which it uses to build up its coherent systems are not expressing emotions. The conclusion I shall arrive at is that the feld equations of gravitat10n which I bave charnpioned hitherto still need a slight modification, so that on the basis of the general theory of relativity those fundamental difficulties may be avoided which bave been set fortb in 1as confronting tbe Newtonian theory. The conclusions reached in this way can be proved or disproved by observation. The concpt of the bodily object is replaced in the foundations by the concept of the materiai point, by which means mechanics becomes fundamentally atomistic.
The condition ill the followillg proposition suffices; a system of coordinates moving in the same direction and at the same rate as a system of inertia is itself a system of inertia. The condition is most naturally expressed as fol- lows: the acceleration of a system falling freely in a given gravitational field is in- dependent of the nature of the falling system (specially therefore also of its energy content) . The conditions (4) are called the conditions of orthogonality, and the transformations (3), (4), linear orthogonal transformations. The cone consists of two parts with O as apex, one part having /<0', the other having />0. The confidence which physicists place in this principle springs from the successes achieved by the electro-dynamics of Clerk Maxwell and Lorentz.
The confident belief that this ultimate goal may be reached is the chief source of the passionate devotion which has always animated the researcher. The connec- tion between force and the change of velocity and not, as we should think according to our intuition, the connection between force and the velocity itself is the basis of classical mechanics as formulated by Newton. The connection between concepts and statements on the one hand and the sensory data on the other hand is established through acts of counting and measuring whose performance is sufficiently well determined. The connection between force and change in velocity has to be established so that we can formulate the clue which will enable us to understand the general problem of motion.
The connection between force and distance is invariant with respect to the classical transformation. The connection between the wire and the source of the current is suddenly broken. The connection of force and accelera- tion was only made possible for him by the intro- duction of the new concept of mass, which was supported, strange to say, by an illusory definition. The connection of the elementary concepts of every day thinking with complexes of sense experiences can only be comprehended intuitively and it is unadaptable to scientifically logical fixation.
The connection of the elementary concepts of everyday thinking with com necessary to make this differentiation only when one examines the degree to STRATIFICATION OF THE SCIENTIFIC SYSTEM The aim of science is, on the one hand, a comprehension, as complete as possible, of the connection between the sense ex plexes of sense experiences can only be comprehended intuitively and it is un adaptable to scientifically logical fixa periences in their totality, and, on the other hand, the accomplishment of this tion. The conquering peoples established themselves, Iegally and economically, as the privileged class of the conquered country. The conquering peoples established themselves, legally and economically, as the privileged class of the conquered country.
The consciousness of this extraordinary state of affairs would be unbearable but for one great consoling thought: it is a welcome symptom in an age which is commonly denounced as materialistic, that it makes heroes of men whose ambitions lie wholly in the intellectual and moral sphere. The consequence is that the repre? The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. The consequence of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations that in a vacuum light is propagated with the velocity c, at least with respect to a definite inertial system K, must therefore be regarded as proved.
The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression. The considerations of Section 20 show that the general principle of relativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the gravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. The constant danger to life there is felt as a serious handicap which makes all healthy development impossible. The construction is never finished; we can always go on laying squares if their laws of disposition correspond to those of plane figures of Euclidean geometry. The construction of a vector diagram of the change in velocity shows that the force on the earth is directed toward the sun.
The contemplation of this world beckoned like a libera- tion, and I soon noticed that many a man whom I had learned to esteem and to admire had found inner free- dom and security in devoted occupation with it. The content of the restricted relativity theory can accordingly be summarized in one sentence: all natural laws must be so conditioned that they are covariant with respect to Lorentz transformations. The continuance and health of human society is therefore in a stili higher degree dependent on the school than formerly. The continuance and health of human society is therefore in a still higher degree dependent on the school than formerly.
The continued development along any line already initiated is more in the nature of evo- lution, until the next turning point is reached when a still newer field must be conquered. The continuous spectrum of QUANTA 28l the sun can thus be obtained. The continuum of many dimensions forms the background for the probability waves, and only for one particle does the number of dimensions equal that of physical space. The contradiction is then evident. The contrast between ether and matter would fade away, and, through the general theory of relativity, the whole of physics would become a complete system of thought, like geometry, kinematics, and the theory of gravitation.
The contrasts and contradictions that can permanently live peacefully side by side in a skull make al!the systems of politica! The contravariant g therefore become infinite and the tensors R'I-~ and RI,-~ take on the form 0/0. The contribution to the stress tensor is then evidently p?? The coordinate system had to be specialized in accordance with the simple rule, that g is made to 1, whereby the equations of the theory experience an eminent simplification. The copper plate of one glass is connected to the zinc of the next, so that only the zinc plate of the first and the copper plate of the last glass remain unconnected. The corpuscular theory does not allow light to bend, and demands the existence of sharp shadows. The corpuscular theory is capable of this, as we know.
The correctness of the theory is judged by the degree of agreement between the con- clusions of the theory and human experience. The correspondence between certain visual and tactile impressions, the fact that they can be con- tinuously followed out through time, and that the im- pressions can be repeated at any movement (taste, sight), are some of those characteristics. The corresponding problem for light must be for- mulated a little differently. The cosmic element is much stronger in Buddhism, as, in particular, Schopenhauer's magnificent essays have shown us. The country also possesses almost all important raw materials. The course of electro-magnetic events in a vacuum seems to be completely determined by that inner law, independently of other physical quantities.
The course of events in the last few years has once more shown us how little we are justified in leaving the struggle against armaments and against the war spirit to the Governments. The covariance of these fundamental equations, when subjected to tbe Lorentz-transformation is a purely mathematical fact i.e. The craving for power which characterises the govern- ing class in every nation is hostile to any limitation of the national sovereignty. The creation of an international court of arbitration is not enough. The crisis has also been attributed to other causes which we will now consider. The crisis has also purified our attitude to the question of Palestine, purged it of the dross of nationalism.
The crisis which the work of construction has had to face in the last few years has lain heavy upon us and is not yet completely surmounted. The crucial experiment just considered enables us to test the theory of motion through the ether-sea. The crucial value of an experiment is re- vealed only by the way the question is formulated, and only one theory of the phenomena can be put on trial by it. The crystal plate must be thin so that we are able to see a source of light through it. The cult of individual personalities is always, in my view, unjustified. The cult of individuals is always, in my view, unjustified. The current is deter- mined by the change, however it may be caused, of the number of lines passing the surface.
The current version of this document is available in a variety of formats from the editorOs Web site: http://www.fourmilab.ch/ 1 The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is of course contained in MaxwellOs equations. The current, and therefore the elec- tric field, too, vanishes when the magnet is again at rest. The curvature of space is variable in time ad place, according to the distribution of matter, but we may roughly approximate to it by means of a spherical space. The curved lines of force are closed, and surround the solenoid in a way character- istic of the magnetic field of a current.
The danger of such a belief lies in the fact that it encourages fanatica!intolerance on the part of all the "faithful" by making a possible social method into a type of church which brands ali those who do not belong to it as traitors or as nasty evildoers. The danger of war in our time is further heightened by another technical factor. The dashed system has got the same meaning for the velocity 71^' after the transformation as the first system of values has o:ot for it before transformation.
The de Broglie- Schrddinger method, which has in a certain sense the character of a field-theory, does indeed deduce the existence of only-discrejte states, in astonishing agreement with empirical fact, on a basis of differ- ential equations operating with a kind of resonance- theory, but it has to do without a localization of the mass-particles and without strictly causal laws. The decision at this point would be more a matter of taste than of scientific conviction. The decisive step in the transition to general co-variant equations would certainly not have been taken if the above interpretation had not served as a stepping-stone. The decomposition of white light into its components, as described here, is called the dispersion of light.
The defining equation of the metric is thus nothing but the Pythagorean theorem applied to the differentials and the co-ordinates. The delegates of ffty-five governments, meeting in the second General Assembly of the United Nations, undoubtedly will be aware of the fact that during the last two years-since the victory over the Axis powers-no appreciable progress has been made either toward the prevention of war or toward agreement in specifc fields such as control of atomic energy and economie cooperation in the reconstruction of war-devastated areas. The deliberate nurturing of the moral sense also outside the religious sphere, however, should help also in this, to lead men to look upon social prob?
The demand for simplicity leads to the picture of particles attracting or repelling each other; Attraction * * Repulsion any other assumption about the direction of the acting forces would give a much more complicated picture. The democratic, parliamentarian regime, which is based on such independence, has in many places been shaken, dictatorships have sprung up and are tolerated, because men's sense of the dignity and the rights of the individual is no longer strong enough. The democratic, parliamentarian regime, which is based on such independence, has in many places been shaken; dictatorships have sprung up and are tolerated, because men's sense of the dignity and the rights of the individuai is no longer strong enough. The demonstration is very simple.
The density ?, of a material substance and the hydrodynamical pressures are the fundamental concepts upon which such a description is based. The density of matter (or of energy) has tensor character (specifically, it constitutes a symmetrical tensor). The desire far guidance, love, and support prompts men to form the social or moral conception of God. The desire for guidance, love, and support prompts men to form the social or moral conception of God. The desire to have, far the foundations of the theory, the greatest possible unity has resulted in several attempts to elude the gravitational .feld and the electromagnetic field m one format but homogeneous picture. The destiny of civilized humanity depends more than ever on the moral forces it is capable of generating.
The detective must look for letters, fingerprints, bullets, guns, but at least he knows that a murder has been committed. The determinant of /is therefore the square of the -A combination, by Det ./we shall denote]the expression 4. The determination of the specific heats of two bodies of the same kind, at equal temperatures attained by friction and heat flow respectively, is a typical ex- ample of a crucial experiment. The determination of this number was the object of Joule's researches. The development during the present century is characterized by two theoretical systems essentially independent of each other: the theory of relativity and the quan? The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in a nation's life.
The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in peoples' lives. The development of electricity and magnetism has pro- ceeded right down to our own day along Newtonian lines (electrical and magnetic substance, forces acting at a distance). The development of generai ability for independent thinking and judgment should always be placed foremost, not the acquisition of special knowledge. The development of general ability for in? The development of mechanical methods of warfare is such that human life will become intolerable if people do not before long discover a way of preventing war.
The development of non-Euclidean geometry led to the recognition of the fact, that we can cast doubt on the infiniteness of our space without coming into conflict with the laws of thought or with experience (Riemann, Helmholtz). The development of science and of the creative activities of the spirit in generai requires stili another kind of freedom, which may be cbaracterized as inward freedom. The development of science and of the creative activities of the spirit in general requires stili another kind of freedom, which may be characterized as inward freedom. The development of the kinetic theory of matter is one of the greatest achievements directly influenced by the mechanical view. The development of the mechanical and field views gives many examples of this kind.
The development of the so-called wave mechanics, begun by de Broglie and Schrodinger, less than fifteen years ago, is a typical example of the achievement of a successful theory by means of a deep and fortunate analogy. The development of the theory of electricity along the path opened up by Maxwell and Lorentz gave the development of our ideas concerning the ether quite a peculiar and unexpected turn. The development of the theory of relativity proceeded in two steps, ..special theory of relativity" and ..genera!theory of relativity."
The development of the theory of the electro-magnetic field once Newton^s hypothesis of forces acting at a distance had been abandoned led to the attempt to explain the Newtonian law of motion on electro- magnetic lines or alternatively to replace it by a more accurate one based on the field-theory. The development of theoretical physics shows, however, that we cannot pursue this course. The development of this thought world is in a certain sense a continuous flight from "wonder." The deviation from the gas equation of the classical thory. The deviation from the normal can thus be calculated for any other moment from the mathematical equations for the oscillating cord.
The di:fferential equations of Maxwell connect the spacial and tempora!differential coe.fficients of the electric and magnetic fields. The dialogue between JV and H shows that this is no easy task. The difference between the co- variant and the contra- variant four-vector lies in the transformation laws . The difference between the co- variant and the contra- variant four-vector lies in the transformation laws [ (7) and (5)].
The difference between the two concepts is made clear by the analogy : 7 Electric potential Temperature Electric charge Heat / Two conductors, for example two spheres of dif- ferent size, may have the same electric charge, that is the same excess of one electric fluid, but the potential will be different in the two cases, being higher for the smaller and lower for the larger sphere. The difference between the two determinations of mass is that the first has nothing to do with the force of gravity while the second is based essentially on its existence. The difference of these two expressions is, according to the Energy principle, the amount of work exerted, by the pressure of light per unit of time.
The difference of these two expressions is, by the principle of energy, the work done by the pressure of light in the unit of time. The difference persists, and according to the fluids theory it must cause a constant flow of electric fluid from the higher potential level (copper plate) to the lower (zinc plate). The differences can be calculated and a suitable experimental test devised. The differential law is the only form which com- pletely satisfies the modern physicists demand for causality. The difficulties concerning the boundary conditions between two media were resolved using the theory's fundamental principles.
The difficulties connected with the deflection of the magnetic needle, the difficulties connected with the structure of the ether, induced us to create a more subtle reality. The difficulties in designing a mechanical ether would be much simpler in this case. The difficulties mentioned that of an inertial system and that of absolute motion are strictly connected with each other. The difficulties of applying the old view have been outlined for one instance only, that of diffraction phenomena. The difficulties set forth above are removed by setting in piace of field equations (1) the field equations f (la) where T.. denotes the energy-tensor of the electromagnetic field given by (3). The difficulties thus seemed practi- cally unsurmountable.
The difficulties we have been through have also brought some good in their train. The difficulty appeared insurmountable, until it was over? The difficulty lies in the fact that the variational properties of radiation, as expressed in the above formula, offer few reference points for setting up such a theory. The diffraction of light was the strongest argument influencing our decision. The diffraction pattern gives the length of a wave of matter and the perfect quantitative agreement between theory and experiment confirms the chain of our argument splendidly. The dimensions of Einsteinian universe would depend on the quantity of matter in it ; it would vanish to a point in the total absence of matter.
The dimensions of the lift must be limited so that the equality of acceleration of all bodies relative to the outside observer may be assumed. The direction in which the wave spreads and the line on which the oscillations lie are the same. The direction of a radius vector OA' drawn from to the point A' of ("2), and the directions of the tan<?ents to {%) at A' are to be called normal to each other. The direction of the force acting on the stone is just that of the change in velocity, and we have seen how it may be determined. The disc-shadows are not rigid figures. The discharge of electricity in a tube containing gas produces a source of light such as seen in the neon tubes used for luminous advertisements.
The disconnection of a current must be accompanied by the appearance of a strong, momentary induced current. The discovery and use of scientific reasoning by Galileo was one of the most important achievements in the history of human thought, and marks the real beginning of physics. The discovery of general laws in the field of economics is made difficult by the circumstance that observed economic phenomena are often affected by many factors which are very hard to evaluate separately. The discovery of nuclear chain reactions need not bring about the destruction of mankind, any more than did the dis? The discovery that the cause of the motions of the heavenly bodies is identical with the gravity with which we are so familiar from everyday life must have been particularly impressive.
The discshadows are not rigid figures. The displacentent of spectral lines towards the red end of the spectrum was definitely established by Adams in 1924, by observations on the dense companion of Sirius, for which the effect is about thirty times greater than for the Sun. The disposition of the individual is everywhere better than the official pronouncements. The distance between these points A and B is then measured by repeated application of thee measuring-rod along the embankment. The distance between these two points, measured by the measuring-rod already employed, which in this case is at rest, is also a length which may be designated Othe length of the rod. The distance is not invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation.
The distance of the bodies from one another is in\^riable. The distance of two points is, therefore, invariant^ that is, independent of the choice of the c.s. The distances between the atoms, as found from the theory of the crystal structure, are so small that they might be expected to show the effect of diffraction for X-rays. The distances between the diffracting ob- stacles in the crystal are so small that diffraction for X-rays can be produced. The distances between two points of our space of reference, measured by a measuring rod, is expressed in such co-ordinates in a particularly simple manner.
The distances of the points from the space axis represent the time co-ordinates as registered in the first column of our "timetable," and the distances from the time axis their space co-ordinates. The distribution of the visible stars is extremely irregular, so that we on no account may venture to set down the mean density of star-matter in the universe as equal, let us say, to the mean density in the Milky Way. The divergence equations then take the form (19b) hx?? The division leads to an idealized experiment, for a physical process in which only the mechanical aspect appears can be only imagined but never realized. The doctor probably acts mechanically, but he applies physical principles without thinking about it. The doctrine of the conservation of mass lost its independence and be?
The dominant economie minority, heretofore autonomous and responsible to no one, has placed itself in opposition to this limitation of its freedom of action, demanded for the good of the whole people. The doom of the Conference would be sealed if the delegates came to it with ready-made instructions, the carrying out of which would soon become a matter of prestige. The dot on the curve in our drawing shows the position of the particle at some instant of time. The dotted vector we call the change in velocity. The drawing is now identical with that on p. 18, *->.........> and the previous concept is regained as a special case of the new one. The drawing of the field, correctly interpreted, represents the direction of the gravitational force and its depend- ence on distance.
The drawing shows two solenoids: one, small, through which a current flows, and the other, in which the induced current is detected, larger. The drop in velocity at the containing walls thereby gradually diminishes. The dropping-out of the two powers, China and Russia. The dual vector of \_w, 8'] shall be written as .^ If 2V is a spaee-time vector of the 1st kind, ,/ of the second kind, 10f signifies a 1x4 series matrix. The dx'" are expressed as linear and hornogeneous functions of the dxv. The earth and the sun, though so far apart, are both actors in the play of forces. The earth is a great magnetic dipole.
The earth is the rigid body to which the specification of place refers; " Times Square, New York," is a well-defined point, to which a name has been assigned, and with which the event coincides in space.2) This primitive method of place specification deals only with places on the surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of points on this surface which are distinguishable from each other. The earth produces in its surrounding a gravitational field, which acts on the stone and produces its motion of fall. The earth's crust plays such a dominant role in our daily life in judging the relative positions of bodies that it has led to an abstract conception of space which certainly cannot be defended.
The earths orbit would thereby be empirically determined, apart from its absolute size, of course. The easiest forces to imagine are those of attraction and repulsion. The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. The economic stress which political events bring in their train does not hit everybody equally hard. The economie anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. The economie rise of the lower classes since the War. The ecpiation (.51) teaches us how to introduce the energy-tensor (corresponding to the density of Poisson's equation) in the field equations of gravitation.

The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism. The educational inHuence which is exercised upon the pupil by the accomplishment of one and the same work may be widely different, depending upon whether fear of hurt, egoistic passion, or desire far pleasure and satisfaction is at the bottom of this work. The effect is that of a force, perpendicular to the plane, acting on the magnetic pole. The effect of the other ends of the rods is negligible if the rods are long enough.
The effect of what is called friction has been diminished, both in the wheels and between the wheels and the road. The effects of gravitation also are regarded in an analogous manner. The effects of the new institution in this direction are likely to be all the more advantageous as a result of the fact that the circumstances of its birth rule out every sort of political purpose. The effects of the new institution in this direction are likely to be all the more advantageous from the fact that the circumstances of its birth rule out every sort of political purpose. The effort to overcome these two illusions is not independent the one of the other. The efforts of the American negroes in this direction are deserving of all commendation and assistance.
The efforts of their responsible leaders are directed primarily to remedying the serious unemployment at home. The ejected electrons leaving the body with the largest normal velocity will be those that were directly at the surface. The elaborahon of th1s requrre? The elastic solid ether became gradually transformed into the electromagnetic one. The elec- tron may be under the influence of an arbitrary foreign electromagnetic field, or free from all external influences. The electric and magnetic field or, in short, the electromagnetic field is, in Maxwell's theory, something real. The electric and magnetic lines of force always lie, as deduced from the theory, on planes perpen- dicular to the direction of propagation.
The electric field is produced by a changing magnetic field, quite independently, whether or not there is a wire to test its existence; a magnetic field is produced by a changing electric field, whether or not there is a magnetic pole to test its existence. The electric fluid flows from the conductor having the higher potential to that having the lower. The electric fluid will have greater density and^thus be more com- pressed on the small conductor. The electric masses are nothing more than places of non-disappearing divergency of the electric field. The electro-magnetic field seems to be the final ir- reducible reality, and it seems superfluous at first sight to postulate a homogeneous, isotropic etheric medium, of which these fields are to be considered as states.
The electro-magnetic fields are not states of a medium but independent realities, which cannot be reduced to terms of anything else and are bound to no substratum, any more than are the atoms of ponderable matter. The electromagnetic field appears as a formal unit; the way in which the electric field enters this equation is determined by the way in which the magnetic field enters it. The electromagnetic field carries energy which, once emitted from its source, leads an independent existence. The electromagnetic field is, for the modern physicist, as real as the chair on which he sits.
The electromagnetic fields appear as ultimate, irreducible realities, and at first it seems superfluous to postulate a homogeneous, isotropic ether-medium, and to envisage electromagnetic fields as states of this medium. The electromagnetic fields are not states of a medium, and are not bound down to any bearer, but they are independent realities which are not reducible to anything else, exactly like the atoms of ponderable matter. The electromagnetic wave spreads in empty space. The electron behaves like a particle when moving in an external electric or magnetic field. The electron is indivisible and can, it would seem, pass through only one of the two holes. The electrons were emitted with ALBERT EINSTEIN 37 all velocities, but there is generally a maximum limit.
The elementary particles obey Newton' s law of motion for the materia!point. The elementary process of emission is not invertible. The elementary process of the emission of radiation appears to be directional. The elements of the physical reality cannot be determined by a priori philosophical con- siderations, but must be found by an appeal to results of experiments and measurements. The elements which form their basis and starting-point are not hypothetically constructed but empirically discovered ones, general character- istics of natural processes, principles that give rise to mathematically formulated criteria which the separate processes or the theoretical representations of them have to satisfy.
The enclosed article sets forth my beliefs as to the reasons for the stalemate which confronts us today in the vitally important negotiations on international atomic energy control. The ends of the magnets are called their poles. The ends of the two magnets are brought together in such a way that a strong attraction is noticed between them. The energy (measured in the stationary system) which is incident upon unit area of the mirror in unit time is evidently A2(ccos??v)/81. The energy E is equal to two-thirds the kinetic energy of a free monatomic gas particle because of the equality the time average values of the kinetic and potential energies of the oscillator. The energy given up was part of the mass of the object. The energy increase E is connected with the mass classical mechanics ).
The energy leaving the unit of surface of the mirror in the unit of time is A0002(?ccos?000 + v)/81. The energy levels are, as a rule, not continuous but discontinuous. The energy of a ponderable body cannot be subdivided into arbitrarily many or arbitrarily small parts, while the energy of a beam of light from a point source (according to the Maxwellian theory of light or, more generally, according to any wave theory) is continuously spread an ever increasing volume. The energy that belongs to the mass m is equal to this mass, multiplied by the square of the enormous speed of light-which is to say, a vast amount of energy for every unit of mass. The ensemble of all continuations of body A we can designate as the "space of the body A."
The ensemble of three quantities, defined for every system of Cartesian co-ordinates, and which transform as the components of an interval, is called a vector. The entire curves are to be varied in any possible manner inside the >^icliel, while the end p)oints on the lower and upper boundaries remain fixed, and the individual substantial points upon it are displaced in such a manner that they alwavs move forward normal to the curves. The entropy, and thus the statistical and thermodynamical behaviour of the system, is then determined by Boltzmanns theorem.
The epoch-making theoretical investigations of H. A. Lorentz on the electrodynamical and optical phenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in this domain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of which the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a necessary consequence. The equality of these two masses, so differently defined, is a fact which is confirmed by experiments of very high accuracy (experiments of Estvss), and classical mechanics offers no explanation for this equality. The equation E = mc2 has been thoroughly proved time and again since this time. The equation of this surface expressed in x, y, z at the time t = 0. The equations (52) can be easily so transformed that the second member on the right-hand side vanishes.
The equations (6) and (7) therefore adopt the form (6a) , (7a) which equations, together with ?s = A + Bs2/3 , determine the constants A and B. The equations (60), (62), a.od (63) thus form the generalization of Maxwell's field equations for free space, with the convention which we have established with respect to the choice of co-ordinates. The equations (67) and (68) together, are equivalent to Newton's law of gravitation. The equations (8), (10), (12) are tbemselves examples of outer multiplication of tensors of the first rank. " The equations 6) and 7), as they stand in pairs, can be expressed as. The equations allow us to predict what will happen a little farther in space and a little later in time, if we know what happens here and now.
The equations also permit the existence of true mas^netism ; if we do not take into account this consideration, div. The equations of Newtonian mechanics show a two- fold invariance, (?') The equations of electromagnetic field are invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation and the mechanical equations are invariant with respect to the classical transformation. The equations of motion of a material particle are m d xdt2 2? The equations of the gravitation-field free from matter must thus be in everv case satisfied when all & vanish. The equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass is taken into account. The escape from this unsatisfactory situation by tbe electric field theory of Faraday and Maxwell represents probably the most profound transformation which has been experi?
The escape into isolationism is not difficult to understand if one realizes what Russia has suffered at the hands of foreign countries during the last three decades-the German invasions with planned mass murder of the civilian population, foreign inter? The essence of that conception seems to me to lie in an affirmative attitude to the life of all creation. The essential assumption of the wave theory of light is that different wave-lengths correspond to different colours. The essential point about this process is the relation between what the worker produces and what he is paid, both measured in terms of real value.
The essential point is, that the electric and magnetic forces of light, which are influenced by a moving body, should be transformed to a system of co-ordinates which is stationary relative to the body. The essential thing is the aim to represent the multi In order to supplement this deficiency, one invents a system poorer in concepts tude of concepts and propositions, close and relations, a system retaining the pri to experience, as propositions, logically mary concepts and relations of the "first deduced from a basis, as narrow as pos layer" as logically derived concepts and sible, of fundamental concepts and fun tain anything else.
The essential thing is the aim to represent the multitude of concepts and theorems, close to experience, as theorems, logically deduced and belonging to a basis, as narrow as possible, of fondamenta} concepts and fundamental relations which themselves can be chosen freely ( axioms ) . The essential unity of ecclesiastical and secular cultura! The essentially new thing here is that for the first time we consider the motion of something which is not matter, but energy propagated through matter. The establishment of this general principle of rela- tivity is made easier by a fact of experience that has long been known, namely that the weight and the in- ertia of a body are controlled by the same constant. The establishment of this opinion is reserved for a separate tract.
The establishment of this world government must not have to wait until the same conditions of freedom are to be found in all three of the great powers. The ether appears indistinguishable in its functions from ordinary matter. The ether does not exist at all. The ether in our laboratories was assumed to not participate in the Earth's motion completely, just as the ether did not participate in the water's motion completely in Fizeau's experiment. The ether of the general theory of relativity can be transformed intellectually into Lorentzs through the substitution of constants for the spatial functions which describe its state, thus neglecting the causes conditioning the latter.
The ether of the general theory of relativity is a medium which is itself devoid of all mechanical and kinematical qualities, but helps to determine mechanical (and electromagnetic) events. The ether of the general theory of relativity is a medium which is itself free of all mechanical and kinematic properties, but helps to determine mechan- ical (and electro-magnetic) happenings. The ether of the general theory of relativity is transmuted conceptually into the ether of Lorentz if we substitute constants for the functions of space which describe the former, disregarding the causes which condition its state. The ether thus became a kind of matter whose only function was to act as a substratum for electrical fields which were by their very nature not further analyzable.
The ether was only accepted as the seat of all opera- tions of force which make themselves effective across space. The ethical behavior of man is better based on sympathy, education, and social relationships, and requires no support from religion. The evolution of electrical theory along the linei. The exact expression for the force of a current act- ing on a magnetic pole is quite complicated, much more so, indeed, than the expression for gravitational forces. The exact relation would be e:xpressed as mgh = i;v2, with g represent?
The examination of the correctness or otherwise of this deduction is a problem of the greatest importance, the early solution of which is to be expected of astronomers.1) In the second place our result shows that, according to the general theory of relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in the special theory of relativity and to which we have already frequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. The example I saw before me was thermodynamics. The example of great and pure characters is the only thing that can produce fine ideas and noble deeds. The example of great and pure individuals SOCIETY AND PERSONA.LITY is the only thing that can lead us to noble thoughts and deeds.
The example of the two pinholes shows this clearly. The exercise of any socially valuable activity gives inner satisfaction; but it cannot be considered as part of the salary. The existence and validity of human rights are not written in the stars. The existence of a never-diminishing motion seems contrary to all experience. The existence of elementary quanta of matter and energy cannot be doubted. The existence of sharp spectral lines is a convincing experimental proof of the above-mentioned principle of practical geometry. The existence of sharp spectral lines is a convincing experimental proof of the abovementioned principle of practical geometry.
The existence of the Spectroscopic binaries, and the fact that they follow Kepler's Law is therefore a proof that c is not affected by the motion of the source. The existence of the ether seemed beyond doubt. The existence of the field manifests itself, indeed, only when electrically charged bodies are intro? The existence of the gravitational field is directly bound up with the existence of space. The existence of the gravitational field is inseparably bound up with the existence of space. The experi- ments with )8-rays and high-velocity cathode rays did much to shake confidence in the strict validity of Newtons mechanical equations.
The experiences of an individual appear to us arranged in a series of events; in this series the single events which we remember appear to be ordered according to the criterion of "earlier" and "later," which cannot be analysed further. The experiment is a rather difficult one, and many physicists tried in vain to observe the effect. The experiment is concerned with the following question. The experiment is performed as follows: we look to see whether the leaves hang close together, for this is their normal position. The experiment which actually revealed the great difficulties in applying the mechanical ideas must sound strange to anyone hearing about it for the first time.
The experimental arguments in favour of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, which are at the same time arguments in favour of the theory of relativity, are too numerous to be set forth here. The experimental verdict was always negative. The experimental work of Kaufmann, in 1901, made it abundantly clear that the " mass '^ of an electron dei)ended on its velocity. The experiments described here show the diffraction of light, the deviation from the rectilinear propagation when small holes or obstacles are placed in the way of the light wave. The experiments of Oersted and Faraday can be regained from Maxwell's theory, but only by the summation of small steps each of which is governed by Maxwell's equations. The experiments performed by Coulomb showed that this law is really valid.
The experiments show that the resistance offered by these particles depends on the velocity, in the way foreseen by the theory of relativity. The explanation for alternating light and dark areas will be clear in the case of a somewhat different experimental arrangement. The explanation is probably to be sought in those phenomena which have given rise to the theory of action at a distance, and in the properties of light which have led to the undulatory theory. The explanation of refraction is a little more difficult. The explanation of the facts of electrodynamics within the Newtonian system was more forced; least convincing of all, from the very beginning, was the theory of light.
The explanation of this phenome- non is as follows : ^The rotation of the liquid causes a centrifugal force to act on it. The expression (w/) gives four components, but the fourth can be derived from the first three. The expression for a force acting between a wire through which a current flows and a magnetic pole is very complicated. The expression for this is dr v^-^ i.e., if we deduct from this the additive constant w<?-, we obtain the expression \ inv^ of Newtonian-mechanics upto magnitudes of the order of -^.
The expression on the right-hand side of (81), which equals + (em) (EM), is = 0, because (evi =: e ^ ^, (EM) = // ^ ^ now referring > back to 79), we can denote the positive square root of this expression as Det * S. Since f = f^ and F = F, we obtain for S, the transposed matrix of S, the following relations from (78), (84) F/ = S-L,/* F* = -"S-L, ThenisS-S= | S.^-S,, an alternating matrix, and denotes a space-time vector of the second kind. The extension of this result, to include events which take place outside the x-axis, is obtained by retaining equations (8) and supplementing them by the relations In this way we satisfy the postulate of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo for rays of light of arbitrary direction, both for the system K and for the system K'.
The external forces "!ere here represented by small additions of the potential energy as functions of the time. The external pressure bearing upon the Jewish people is particularly great at present. The external reason for this meeting is the Gumbel case. The fact can also be described thus: In a gravitational feld different masses receive the same ac? The fact is that since the amount of work needed to supply everybody's needs has been reduced through the improvement of technical methods, the free play of economic forces no longer produces a state of affairs in which all the available labour can find employment.
The fact of the equality of inert and heavy mass thus leads quite nat- urally to the recognition that the basic demand of the special theory of relativity (invariance of the laws under Lorentz-transformations) is too narrow, i.e., that an invariance of the laws must be postulated also relative to non-linear transformations of the coordinates in the four-dimensional continuum. The fact of the small velocit1es of the stars allows the conclusion that wherever there are f.xed stars, the gravitational poten tial (in our case ,.jB ) can never be much greater tban bere on earth.
The fact that I neglected mathematics to a certain extent had its cause not merely in my stronger interest in the natural sciences than in mathematics but also in the following strange experience, I saw that mathematics was split up into numerous specialities, each of which could easily absorb the short lifetime granted to us. The fact that all these methods support the same view is most important, for it demonstrates the internal consistency of the kinetic theory of matter. The fact that conclusions of this kind can really be drawn and that they stand the test of experiment is an essential argument in favour of the electromagnetic theory of light.
The fact that in this special case, the relation is satisfied, suffices to establish the theorem (45) generally, for this relation has a covariant character in case of a Lorentz transformation, and is homogeneous in (w^, m^. The fact that it is comprehensible is a miracle. The fact that on the basis of such laws we are able to predict the tempora! The fact that on the basis of such laws we are able to predict the tempora} behavior of phenomena in certain domains with great precision and certainty is deeply embedded in the con? The fact that quantum mechanics words, in such a simple manner, statements concerning ( apparently ) discontinuous transitions from one total condition to another without actu?
The fact that some definite deviation from the normal position corresponds to every point of the cord is expressed more rigorously as follows: for any in- stant, the deviation from the normal value is a function of the co-ordinates of the cord. The fact that such a metric is called Euclidean is connected with the following. The fact that the cat reacts in a similar way toward any mouse it meets shows that it forms concepts and theories which are its guide through its own world of sense impressions. The fact that the energy withdrawn from the body becomes energy of radiation evidently makes no difference, so that we are led to the more general conclusion that The mass of a body is a measure of its energy-content; if the energy changes by L, the mass changes in the same sense by L/9 ?
The fact that the experiment was re- peated many times points to another way out. The fact that the velocity of light does not depend on the motion of the source contradicts this assumption. The fact that the world-postulate holds without excep- tion is, 1 believe, the true essence of an electromagnetic picture of the world ; the idea first occurred to Lorentz, its essence was first picked out by Einstein, and is now gradu- ally fully manifest. The fact that their velocities are the same suggests a close relationship between optical and electromagnetic phenomena. The fact that there are only three nations with great military power should make it easier, rather than harder, to establish such a government.
The fact that we use a positively and not a negatively charged test body is merely a convention, indicating in which direc- tion the arrows on the line of force should be drawn. The fact tions, which express at least indirect re that it is comprehensible is a miracle. The facts mentioned so far led to the formu- lation of these equations, but their content is much richer than we have been able to indicate. The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. The familiar appear- ance of a stick which seems to be bent in the middle if half-immersed in water is one of the many manifestations of refraction. The farther away the portion is, and the smaller we choose to take it, the more it resembles a plane.
The farther we place the shaded portion of our drawing from the centre of the spheres and the smaller the angle between the two radii, the better our representation of a plane wave. The faster a stick moves, the shorter it appears. The fatai error that the necessity of thinking, preceding all experience, was at the basis of Euclidian geometry and the concept of space belonging to it, this fatai error arose from the fact that the empirica!basis, on which the axiomatic construction of Euclidian geometry rests, had fallen into oblivion. The fatal psychological effect of the military education of the people and the violation of the individual's rights which it involves would thus be avoided. The fate of an atom does not depend on its age.
The fate of the world will be such as the world deserves. The federai government is endeavoring to solve this problem by systematic control over economie processes- that is to say, by a limitati.on of the so-called free interplay of the fundamental economie forces of supply and demand. The feeling of security in regard to human aims and values remained, for the main part, un?
The field as representation The two pillars of the field theory The reality of the field Field and ether The mechanical scaffold Ether and motion Time, distance, re- lativity Relativity and mechanics The time-space con- tinuum General relativity Outside and inside the lift Geometry and experiment General relativity and its verifi- cation Field and matter THE FIELD AS REPRESENTATION DURING the second half of the nineteenth century new and revolutionary ideas were introduced into physics; they opened the way to a new philosophical view, differing from the mechanical one. The field did not exist for the physicist of the early years of the nine- teenth century. The field equations for mat ter-free space formulated m 15 are to be compared with the field equation \JZcp = Q of Newton's theory.
The field equations for vacuum, upon which I based the explanation of the perihelion motion of mercury, remain untouched by this modification. The field equations without denominators can be written ~4=~/( +u-: /2)' ' ds' =du' (u'+ e'/2) (dO'+ si Odng') +L2u'/(2u'+ e') ]dt' :. The field here and now depends on the field in the immediate neighbourhood at a time just past. The field laws on the one hand and the mechanical laws on the other are of quite different kinds. The field near a moving dielectric is naturally proportional to K 1 and not to K. Lorentz's theory thus gave a satisfactory explanation of all those experiments with moving dielectrics which required effects proportional to K 1. The field of a bar magnet can be represented in the same way as that of a current.
The field of a charged conductor can be introduced in much the same way as the gravitational field, or the field of a current or magnet. The field proved a very helpful concept. The field representation yields its first fruit ! The field was at first considered as something which might later be inter- preted mechanically with the help of ether. The field, as determined by differential equations, takes the place of the farce. The field-ec[iiations established in the preceding para- graph for spaces free from matter is to be compared with the e((uation v^<^=Oof the Newtonian theory. The field-equations of irravitation contain thus at the same time 4 conditions which are to be satisfied by all material phenomena.
The figure of Newton has, however, an even greater importance than his genius warrants be- cause of the fact that destiny placed him at a turning point in the history of the human intellect. The figure-.r^-^'^-z2+?2 = l, i'>0 () which represents a hjper boloidal shell, contains the space- time points A {iv, y, z, / = 0, 0, 0, 1), and all points A' whicli after a Lorentz-transformation enter into the newly introduced system of reference as {.r , y' , J, /'=0, 0, 0, ! The final motion will be along neither of these two lines, but somewhere between them, nearer the direction of the force if the blow is a hard one and the initial velo- city small, nearer the original line of motion if the blow is gentle and the initial velocity great.
The final result of our discussion is therefore R = i k (Q ~ iv^)pB^. The final result of our discussion is therefore R = i k (Q ~ iv^)pB^[\ - exp(-hv/kT)]. The finest elements of the human soui can flourish only in the fertile soil of a community. The finite range enclosed between Q" and Q' shall be called a space-time sichel^ Ql is the lower boundary, and Q' is the upper boundary of the sichel. The first aim of the generai theory of relativity was a preliminary statement which, by giving up the requirement of constituting a closed thing in itself, could be connected in as simple a manner as possible with the "facts directly ob?
The first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation give for these two ticks : t = 0 and As judged from K, the clock is moving with the velocity v; as judged from this referencebody, the time which elapses between two strokes of the clock is not one second, but seconds, i.e. The first attempt to lay a uniform theoretical foundation was the work of Newton. The first event is the dropping of the stone from 256 feet above the ground at the zero second. The first experiment had nothing whatever to do with gravity, the attraction of the earth. The first forced itself on him out of the necessities of his practice. The first is Newton's general law of motion, the second his law of gravitation. The first is that of logical analysis.
The first is the connection between the changing electric field and the magnetic field. The first is the velocity with which the wave spreads. The first man, A, opens his lantern. The first member of the right hand side of (27) can be written in the form GKXEIJALISED THEORY OV RELATIVITY 1:29 If we replace g^^^ 7^^ A by A ,/ q^^'' 1/^' A by A ' and replace in the transformed first member with the help of ('^4), then from the right-hand side of (27) there arises an expression with seven terms, of which four cancel. The first method was that of Roemer, the second that of Fizeau. The first of these tasks, namely, that of establishing the principles which are to serve as the starting point of his deduction, is of an entirely dif- ferent nature.
The first of these that calls for mention is Lorentzs theory of electrons, in which the field and the elec- trical corpuscles appear side by side as elements of equal value for the comprehension of reality. The first of these two goals requires the promotion of ali knowledge relating to the laws of nature and the laws of socia! The first of these two goals requires the promotion of all knowledge relating to the laws of nature and the laws of socia!processes, that is, the promotion of all scientific en? The first of these, advanced by Leibnitz as long ago as the seventeenth century, was developed in the nineteenth century essentially as a corollary of a principle of mechanics.
The first paper in the present collection forms Einstein's first great contribution to the Principle of Special Relativity. The first part is the product of the matrices (lor /') F, lor /' being regarded as a 1 x 4 series matrix. The first place in this respect must be given to t11e refusal of military service. The first statement expresses the constant character of the velocity of light, the second generalizes the Galilean relativity principle, formulated for mechanical phenomena, to all happenings in nature. The first step in that direction is that we Jews should once more become conscious of our existence as a nationality and regain the self-respect that is necessary to a healthy existence.
The first step to the general theory of relativity was to be found in the so-called "Principle of Equivalence": If in a space free from gravitation a reference system is uniformly accelerated, the reference system can be treated as being "at rest, " provided one interprets the condition of the space with respect to it as a homogeneous gravitational field. The first step towards language was to link acoustically or otherwise commutable signs to sense-impressions. The first success beyond this came with the electromagnetic field, where Maxwell's structure laws connected nearby events. The first success of the field description suggests that it may be convenient to consider all actions of currents, magnets and charges indirectly, i.e., with the help of the field as an interpreter.
The first term mc2 does not contain the velocity, and requires no consideration if we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a point-mass; depends on the velocity. The first thing to be done was to determine these movements empirically from the observations of Tycho Brahe. The first three of equations (1), ('Z), (3), can be expressed in the following way : ' 1. The first two of these may be drawn again so that they have a common starting-point, as we have seen is possible with vectors. The first, that moving bodies carry ether along. The first, which we may call t\\e fore-cone consists of all those points which send light towards O, the second, which we ma}' call the aft-cone.
The first: in considering Oersted's and Rowland's ex- periments, the circular line of the magnetic field coiling itself around the current and the changing electric field had to be shrunk to a point; in considering Faraday's experiment, the circular line of the electric field coiling itself around the changing magnetic field had to be shrunk to a point. The flat beings with their measuring-rods and other objects fit exactly on this surface and they are unable to leave it.
The follow- ing program appears natural, there- fore: the total physical field consists of a scalar field (gravitation) and a vector field (electromagnetic field) ; later insights may eventually make necessary the introduction of still more complicated types of fields; but to begin with one did not need to bother about this. The following forms may be specia.lly noted :? The following is taken from the above mentioned paper of Sommerfeld. The following reflections are based on the Principle of Relativity and on the Principle of Constancy of the velocity of light, both of which we define in the following w^ay : 1. The following reflexions are based on the principle of relativity and on the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light.
The following statement corresponds to the fundamental idea of the general principle of relativity: "All Gaussian co-ordinate systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of the general laws of nature." The following statements can therefore be regarded as fairly certainly proved. The following statements hold generally : Every physical description resolves itself into a number of statements, each of which refers to the space-time coincidence of two events A and B. The following, however, appears to me to be correct in Kant's statement of the problem: in thinking we use, with a certain "right," concepts to which there is no access from the materials of sensory experience, if the situation is viewed from the logical point of view.
The foodstuffs and other goods which the world needs can be produced in far fewer hours of work than formerly. The footnote is as it appeared in the 1923 edition. The force acting on himself, and in fact on all other bodies which are at rest relative to the disc, he regards as the effect of a gravitational field. The force acting on the magnetic pole is, as a result, increased; the deflection from its initial position becomes more distinct. The force acting upon a particular body is always the same for the same change of velocity in the same time. The force between the magnetic pole and the small portions of the wire through which the current flows cannot lie along lines connecting the wire and needle, or the particles of flowing electric fluid and the elementary magnetic dipoles.
The force between two bodies, according to Newton's law, depends only on distance ; time does not enter the picture. The force between two masses depends upon their distance from each other. The force has to pass from one body to another in no time ! The force is directed toward the earth for the same reason that it was directed toward the hand in our former example. The force is perpendicular to these lines ! The force is the same, but it causes accelera- tion or deceleration according to whether the stone is dropped or thrown upward. The force neither repels not attracts but acts perpendicular to the line connecting the needle and the charge.
The force vector always lies on^ the tangent to the line of force and is longest near the poles because the density of the lines is greatest at these points. The force vector lies on the tangent to the line of force, as indicated. The force vector represents the action of the magnet on a positive magnetic pole. The force, as we know, is proportional to the change of velocity. The force, like the velocity or its change, must be represented by a vector and not by a number alone. The forces must in the frst place only obey the law of equality of action and reaction in order that a system of points - permanently connected to each other-may behave like one materiai point. The forces which, relative to this system, are centrifugal, must, in the Newtonian sense, be attributed to inertia.
The foregoing assumptions are all trivial and not usually specified in descriptions of such experiments. The foregoing improvement in the interpretation of the mechanical basis must, however, be paid for in that-as be? The foregomg cons1derahons concern, exclusively, the theory if the field, free of matter. The form and the position of the surface of the second degree is described by this tensor (a). The form there used, "All bodies of reference K, K1, etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena (formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their state of motion," cannot be maintained, because the use of rigid reference-bodies, in the sense of the method followed in the special theory of relativity, is in general not possible in space-time description.
The formal justification for the factor - i in the second Cf. The formal problem should be put as follows : Is there a theory of the continuum in which a new structural element ap- pears side by side with the metric such that it forms a single whole together with the metric ? The formal scheme of this multiplication is taken from the three-dimensional case. The formal similarity between the chromatic distribution curve for thermal radiation and the Maxwell velocity-distribution law is too striking to have remained hidden for long. The former connected the equation of state of the ideai gases, viscosity, di:ffusion and heat conductivity of gases and radiometric pbenomena of gases, and gave the logica!
The formula was shortly afterwards verified by Perrin, Prof, of Chemical Physics in the Sorboniie, Paris. The formulation is chosen, intentionally, in such a way that it expresses clearly, not only the logica!and axiomatic, but also the empirica!content of Euclidian geometry. The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. The formulation of these equations is the most im- portant event in physics since Newton's time, not only because of their wealth of content, but also because they form a pattern for a new type of law. The formulation of this question is indispensable, if mechanics is to pretend to describe the object completely.
The foundation of the ether hypothesis is the experimentally based assumption that the ether is at rest. The four-dimensional formulation of these principles leads to an important conception, that of the energy tensor, which is important for the further development of the theory of relativity. The four-dimensional space is described mathematically by two congruent parts or "sheets, " corresponding to N&0 and u &0, which are joined by a hyperplane r = 2m or u=0 in which g vanishes. The four-dimensional space of the special theory of relativity is just as rigid and absolute as Newtons space. The four-vector ^= 0'F which is called by 3Iinko\vski the cleetric-rest-force (elehtrische Paih-Kraft) is very closelv eonuccicd to Lorentz's Ponderomotive force, or the force acting on a moving charge.
The four-vector i//=:/ojF* has a similar relation to the force acting on a moving magnetic pole. The fourth equation (26) gives then the connection between proper time and the time for the material point. The fragmentary character of natural law, as seen by the primitive observer, was such as to foster a belief in ghosts and spirits. The frequency of an atom situated on the surface of a heavenly body will be somewhat less than the frequency of an atom of the same element which is situated in free space (or on the surface of a smaller celestial body). The frightful dilemma of the politica!world situation has much to do with this sin of omission on the part of our civiliza?
The function of the state to maintain peacef ul and ordered relations among and between its citizens has become increasingly complicated and extensive largely because of the concentration and centralization of the modem industriai apparatus. The functions of individuai states wbuld be to concentrate more or less upon internal affairs; in their relation with other states they would deal only with issues and problems which are in no way conducive to endangering intemational security. The fundamental concept "straight," "plane," etc., accordingly lose their exact meaning in physics.
The fundamental concept of the theory is the concept of state, which is supposed to be completely characterized by the wave function P, which is a function of the variables chosen to describe the particle's behavior. The fundamental concepts of the straight line, the plane, etc., thereby lose their precise significance in physics. The fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize with this view. The fundamental idea of the general co-v^ariant theory is this :With reference to any co-ordinate system, let certain things (tensors) be defined by a number of func- tions of co-ordinates which are called the components of 102 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY the tensor. The fundamental oleetro-niaiL^'Udtic e<| nations of Maxwell for stationary media are : curl -Ua^^-) - ''^ eurl =- 1 oL?
The fundamental principle here is that the justification for a physical concept lies exclusively in its clear and unambiguous relation to facts that can be experienced. The fundamental problem of the theory is that of gravitation. The fundamental property of the oscillation theory that engenders these difficulties seems to me the following. The fundamental trouble seems to me to be the almost unlimited freedom of the labour market combined with extraordinary progress in the methods of production. The fundarnental idea of this general theory of covariants is the followmg :-Let certam things (" tensors ") be defined with respect to any system of co-ordinates by a nurnber of functions of the co-ordinates, called the " components " of the tensor.
The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, This thought is convincingly presented in Herbert Samuel's book, Belief and Action. The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the patl1 to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of!ife, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but tlrrough striving after rational knowledge. The future must decide whether the solution sug- gested by modern physics is enduring or temporary. The future, to him, is every whit as necessary and deter? The future, to him, is every whit as necessary and determined as the past.
The g 's are hereto ht so chosen, that n =n - the summation is to be extended over all values of o- and t, so that the sum is to he extended, over 4x4 terms, of which 12 are equal in pairs. The g corresponding to (1) are regular for all finite points of space-time. The genera!theory of relativity owes its origin to the attempt to explain a fact known since Galileo's and Newton' s time but hitherto eluding all theoretical interpretation: the inertia and the weight of a body, in themselves two entirely distinct things, areameasured by one and the same constant, the mass. The generai theory of relativity is as yet incomplete inso? The general discussion of these equations can proceed by considering the function which expresses the sum in (19b) in terms of the sum in (18b).
The general postulate of relati-vity is unable on principle to tell us anything about this. The general principle of relativity requires that all these molluscs can be used as reference-bodies with equal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws of nature; the laws themselves must be quite independent of the choice of mollusc. The general principle was there given in the theorem: the laws of nature are such that it is impossible to construct a perpetuum mobile (of- the first and second kind). The general public may be able to follow the details of scientific research to only a modest degree; but it can register at least one great and important gain: confidence that human thought is dependable and natural law universal.
The general relativity postulate can teach us no new principle. The general theory of relativity formed the last step in the development of the program of the field-theory. The general theory of relativity owes its existence in the first place to the empirical fact of the numerical equality of the inertial and gravitational mass of bodies, for which fundamental fact classical mechanics provided no interpretation.
The general theory of relativity teaches that the inertia of a given body is greater as there are more ponderable masses in proximity to it; thus it seems very natural to reduce the total effect of inertia of a body to action and reaction between it and the other bodies in the universe, as indeed, ever since Newton's time, gravity has been completely reduced to action and reaction between bodies. The general theory of relativity teaches that the inertia of a given body is greater as there are more ponderable masses in proximity to it; thus it seems very natural to reduce the total effect of inertia of a body to action and reaction between it and the other bodies in the universe, as indeed, ever since Newtons time, gravity has been completely reduced to action and reaction between bodies.
The general theory of relativity, accordingly, proceeds from the fol- lowing principle: natural laws are to be expressed by equations which are covariant under the group of con- tinuous coordinate transformations. The generalised theory has further synthesised space-time and matter into one fundamental physical reality. The generalization of a concept is a process very often used in science. The generalization of the Relativity theory has been made much easier through the farm given to the special Rela- tivity theory by Minkowski, which mathematician was the first to recognize clearly the formal equivalence of the space like and time-like co-ordinates, and who made use of it in the building up of the theory.
The generalization of this principle gives us the law of the conservation of mechanical energy. The generalized calculus of tensors was developed by mathematicians long before the theory of relativity. The generalized law of inertia takes over the function of Newtons law of motion. The geometrical behavior of bodies and the motion of clocks rather depend on gravitational fields, which in their turn are produced by matter. The geometrical nature of our world is shaped by masses and their velocities. The geometry here described differs from the Euclidean in the non-existence of the parallelogram. The gik which form a "symmetric tensor" and are continuous functions of Xi. The gljr/it flf *^r kmtic theory is to present the cop^p^ of matVr just in this way.
The goal, which is the restoration of normal and fruitful co-operation between learned societies, is, however, not yet attained, because the academic world of the Central Powers, exasperated by nearly ten years of exclusion from practically all international gatherings, has got into a habit of keeping itself to itself.

The gofthis field satisfy in general the equations R kl (2) and hence the equations that in g'RI, & there is no longer any denominator. The gold standard has, in my opinion, the serious disadvan?
The gold standard has, in my opinion, the serious disadvantage that a shortage in the supply of gold automatically leads to a contraction of credit and also of the amount of currency in circulation, to which contraction prices and wages cannot adjust themselves sufficiently quickly. The good seed of our Wilson has produced a mighty poor crop in the stony ground of Europe. The gravitational equations have the form of structure laws, as required of all physical laws since the achievements of field theory. The gravitational equations of general relativity can be applied to any c.s. The gravitational equations of general relativity try to disclose the geometrical properties of our world.
The gravitational field is entirely described by the tensor gpa In the three-index symbols r"/1, there appear also the contravariants g which are defined as the minors of the g, divided by the determinant g( = Iga/J I). The gravitational potentials g.v were applied, and from them the energy-tensor T,.. of matter was calculated on the basis of the field equations of gravitation. The great achievements of mechanics in all its branches, its striking success in the development of astronomy, the application of its ideas to problems ap- parently different and non-mechanical in character, all these things contributed to the belief that it is possible to describe all natural phenomena in terms of simple forces between unalterable objects.
The great attraction of the theory is its logica!consistency. The great change was brought about by Faraday, Maxwell and Hertz-as a matter of fact half -unconsciously an against their will. The great charm resulting from this consideration lies in the recognition of the fact that the universe of these beings is finite and yet has no limits. The great detective, however, realizes that no further in- vestigation is needed at the moment, and that only pure thinking will lead to a correlation of the facts collected. The great mystery story The fast clue Vectors The riddle of motion One clue remains Is heat a substance?
The great power possessed by the general principle of relativity lies in the comprehensive limitation which is imposed on the laws of nature in consequence of what we have seen above. The great results of classical mechanics suggest that the mechanical view can be consistently applied to all branches of physics, that all phenomena can be explained by the action offorces representing either attraction or repulsion, depending only upon distance and acting between unchangeable par- ticles. The great superiority of the Cartesian treatment of space is by no means confined to the fact that it applies analysis to the purposes of geometry. The great variety of colours on the earth would immediately vanish.
The greater abstraction required for the four-axes does not cause the mathematician any trouble. The greater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been communicated to us by other people through the medium of a language which others have created. The greatest advance in theoretical optics since the introduction of the oscillation theory was Maxwell's brilliant discovery that light can be understood as an electromagnetic process. The greatest change in the axiomatic sub-structure of physics in other words, of our conception of the structure of reality since Newton laid the founda- tion of theoretical physics was brought about by Faraday's and Clerk Maxwells work on electro- magnetic phenomena.
The greatest enemies of the national consciousness and honour of the Jews are fatty degeneration by which I mean the unconscionableness which comes from wealth and ease and a kind of inner dependence on the surrounding Gentile world which comes from the loosening of the fabric of Jewish society. The greatest practical benefit which all these inventions conf er on man I see in the fact that they liberate him from the excessive mus?

The greatest triumph of this new theory consists, indeed, in the fact that a large number of results, which had formerly required all kinds of special hypotheses for their explanation, are now deduced very simply as inevitable consequences of one single general principle. The greatness of Copernicus' discovery can be appreciated only from the physical point of view. The grounds for my resolve to go to Geneva no more are as follows: Experience has, unhappily, taught me that the Commission, taken as a whole, stands for no serious determination to make real progress with the task of improving international relations.
The grounds for my resolve to go to Geneva no more are as follows: experience has, unhappily, taught me that the Commission, taken as a whole, stands for no serious determination to make real progress in the task of improving international relations. The hallowing of the supra-individual life brings in its train a reverence for everything spiritual a particularly characteristic feature of the Jewish tradition. The hands of service must ever be at work, in arder that the marble continue lastingly to shine in the sun.

The health of society thus depends quite as much on the independence of the individuals composing it as on their close political cohesion. The heuristic value of the theory of invariants, which arises from the isotropy of space (equivalence of all directions), becomes evident from this example. The high price oE labor was the stimulus which evoked the marvelous development of technical devices and methods of work. The high price of labour was the stimulus which evoked the marvellous development of technical devices and methods of work. The highest principles for our aspirations and judgments are given to us in the Jewish-Christian religious tradition. The history of science shows that the simplest generalizations sometimes prove successful and some- times not.
The hitch in this was, of course, that one had to cram all this stuff into one's mind for the examinations. The human mind is unable to conceive of the four dimensions. The human race, in so far as it sets a value on culture, has an interest in preventing such impoverishment. The hyperbolas which lie upon this fiss'nre with O as centre, are important for us. The hypersurface u =0 (or in the original variables, r = 2m) plays here the same role as the hypersurface xl 0 in the previous example. The hypotheses with which it starts become steadily more abstract and remote from experience.
The hypothesis of the non existence of perpetuai motion as a basis for thermodynamics affords such an example of a fundamental hypothesis suggested by experience; the same thing holds for the principle of inertia of Galileo. The idea is very simple : just break a magnet into two equal parts. The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublima? The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old conception of the gods. The idea of motion may not be applied to it. The idea of the measuring- rod and the idea of the clock co-ordinated with it in the theory of relativity do not find their exact correspondence in the real world.
The idea of the measuring-rod and the idea of the clock co-ordinated with it in the theory of relativity do not find their exact correspondence in the real world. The ideal conductor or insulator is a fiction which can never be realized. The ideal thermos flask is analogous to such a safe. The idealized experiment can never be actually performed, although it leads to a profound understanding of real experi- ments. The idealized experiment shows the clue which really formed the foundation of the mechanics of motion. The ideals concerning the conduct of men toward each other and the desirable structure of the community have been conceived and taught by enlightened individuals in the course of history.
The ideals which have lighted me on my way and time after time given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face lfe cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. The ideas must later take the mathe- matical form of a quantitative theory, to make possible the comparison with experiment. The ii8 PRINCIPLE OF RELBTIVriTY sign S corresponds to a passage from a point of the geodetic curve soiight-for to a point of the contiguous curve, both lying on the same surface A,.
The ill-success, despite their obvious sincerity, of all the efforts made during the last decade to reach this goal leaves us no room to doubt that strong psycho- logical factors are at work, which para- lyse these efforts. The illusion which prevailedl prior to the enunciation of the theory of relativity-that, from the point of view of experience the meaning of simultaneity in relation to happenings distant in space and consequently that the meaning of time in physics is a priori clear-this illu? The im'piihe and real cause of inducement for the assumption of the group-traiufor}iLatio}i Gc is the fact that the differential equation for the propagation of light in va-^ant spa'je possesses the group-transformation Gc.
The immediate consequences are the weakening of purchasing power and the devaluation of labor because of excessive com? The importance of a probletn should not be judged by the number of pages devoted to it. The importance of this object is only equalled by the inadequacy of the attempts hitherto made to attain it. The important invention of the electromagnetic field ap- pears. The important point for us to observe is that all these constructions and the laws connecting them can be arrived at by the principle of looking for the mathe- matically simplest concepts and the link between them. The important thing for us is that the adjustment of the distribution of velocities till it be- comes stationary is a slow process.
The important thing is that we can always calculate the position of a particle in one c.s. The in- terval is thus shown to be independent of the selection of any special body to fill it ; the same is universally true of spatial relations. The incompleteness of the representation is the outcome of the statistica!nature (incompleteness ) of the laws. The incor- poration of optics into the theory of electromagnetism, with its relation of the speed of light to the electric and magnetic absolute system of units as well as the relation of the refraction coefficient to the dielectric constant, the qualitative relation between the reflection coefficient and the metallic conductivity of the body N it was like a revelation.

The individual are quantities which vary rapidly with position ; but for our purpose we no doubt may replace them by their mean values. The individual can accomplish little here, nor can one wish to see the best among us devoted to destruction through the machinery behind which stand the three great powers of stupidity, fear, and greed. The individual feels the nothingness of human desires and aims and the sublimity and marvellous order which reveal themselves both in nature and in the world of thought. The individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society.
The individual is able to think, feel, strive, and work by himself; but he depends so much upon societyNin his physical, intellectual, and emotional existenceNthat it is impossible to think of him, or to understand him, outside the framework of society. The individual is wbat he is and bas the sig? The individual is what he is and has the significance that he has not so much in virtue of his individuality, but rather as a member of a great human society, which directs his material and spiritual existence from the cradle to the grave. The individual laws are discarded. The individual names and addresses on the forms are of no account. The individual, if left alone from birth would remain primitive and beast-like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we can hardly conceive.
The industries of the country have been cut off almost completely from the sources of raw materials on which the existence of the industrial part of the population was based. The inert mass of a closed system is identical with its energy, thus eliminating mass as an independent concept. The inertial character of his c.s. The inertial co-ordinate system was no longer needed. The inertial mass of a system of bodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy. The influence of motion (relative to the co-ordinate system) on the form of bodies and on the motion of clocks, also the equiv- alence of energy and inert mass, follow from the interpretation of co-ordinates and time as products of measurement.
The influence of the theory of relativity goes far beyond the problem from which it arose. The inherited prejudices about time and space did not allow any doubt to arise as to the prime importance of the Galileian transformation for changing over from one body of reference to another. The initial and fundamental steps are always of a revolutionary character. The initial height can never be reached by a car on an actual track because of friction, but our hypothetical engineer need not consider that. The initial path of the sphere and the direc- tion of the force are perpendicular to each other. The injunctions of the Bible concerning human conduct were then accepted by believer and infide!alike as self-evident demands for individuals and society.
The injury done to him gives you untold pain, especially as you are really fond of him. The injury done to him gives you uotold pain, especial!y as you are real!y fond of him. The inseparableness of time and space emerged in connection with electrodynamics, or the law of the propagation of light. The inside observer may ignore the gravitational field, since its source lies outside his c.s. The inside observer: My room moves through the ether-sea. The insight which is fundamental for the special theory of relativity is this: the assumptions (1) and (2) are compatible if relations of a new type ("Lorentz- transformation") are postulated for the conversion of co- ordinates and the times of events.
The insistence on the solidarity of all human beings finds still stronger expression, apd it is no mere chance that the demands of Socialism were for the most part first raised by Jews. The instant of an event is the fourth number. The instincts bring thought into action, and thought provokes intermediary actions inspired by emotions which are likewise related to the ultimate end. The integral T= fr/r, taken over the world-line from any fixed initial point P^ to any variable final point P, may be called the " Proper-time " of the substantial point at Po upon t,he icorld-line. The integral can then be brought into the form dB dX1 dyl dZn . The integral is extended over all possible values I of 9. consistent with the conditions of the prob- lem.
The integration is to be extended over a filament of the thread for which ?0 may be regarded as constant over the whole section. The intellectual lite have no direct influence on the history of nations in these days; their lack of cohesion prevents them from taking a direct part in the solution of contemporary problems. The intellectuals always have micro scopes before their eyes. The interchange should follow a carefully elaborated plan, aimed at converting the natfonal armies systematically into a supranational military force. The interests of each country must be subordinated to the interests of the wider community. The internal discrepancies inherent in the classic ether theory had now become too prominent. The international society of the academies was broken up.
The interpretation of religion, as bere advanced, implies a dependence of science on the religious attitude, a relation which, in our predominantly materialistic age, is only tao easily overlooked. The interpretation of the galactic lineshift discovered by Hubble as an expansion (which can hardly be doubted from a theoretical point of view), leads to an origin of this expansion which lies " only " about 109 years ago, while physical astronomy makes it appear likely that the development of individual stars and systems of stars takes considerably longer. The interpretation seemed obvious but classica!
The introduction of a Oluminiferous etherO will prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not require an Oabsolutely stationary spaceO provided with special properties, nor assign a velocity-vector to a point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place. The introduction of a ^^ Lightather" will be proved to be superfluous, for according to the conceptions which will 'be developed, we shall introduce neith er a space absolutely at rest, and endowed with special properties, nor shall we associate a velocity -vector with a point in which electro-magnetic processes take place. The introduction of a system of co-ordinates serves no other purpose than an easy description of totality of such coincidences.
The introduction of a system of reference serves no other purpose than to facilitate the description of the totality of such coincidences. The introduction of co-ordinate systems accelerated relatively to each other as equally legitimate systems, such as they appear conditioned by the identity of inertia and weight, leads, in conjunction with the re- sults of the special theory of relativity, to the conclu- sion that the laws governing the occupation of space by solid bodies, when gravitational fields are present, do not correspond to the laws of Euclidean geometry. The introduction of co-ordinate systems accelerated relatively to inertial systems involves the appearance of gravitational fields relative to the latter.
The introduction of compulsory service is therefore, to my mind, the prime cause of the moral collapse of the white race, which seriously threatens not merely the survival of our civilization but our very existence. The introduction of forces acting directly and instantaneously at a distance into the representation of the effects of gravity is not in keeping with the character of most of the processes familiar to us from everyday life. The introduction of objective time involves two statements which are independent of each other. The introduction of the electromagnetic theory simplified the elements of theoretical optics and reduced the number of arbitrary hypotheses. The introduction of the two names is, of course, arbitrary and justified only by convenience.
The invariant s2 differs, disregarding the number of dimensions, from the corresponding invariant of the Euclidean geometry in the following points. The inverse process does not exist as an elementary process. The ireneralised Relativitv Principle leads us to no further limitation of ])ossibilities ; but it enables us to know exactly the inHuence of gravitation on all processes with- out the introduction of any new h3q3othesis. The irregular and haphazard character of the path of the Brownian particles reflects a similar irregularity in the path of the smaller particles which constitute matter. The isotropy and homogeneity of space is expressed in this way.5 We shall now consider some of the more important equations of physics from this point of view.
The italicized word heats should, according to present- day nomenclature, be replaced by the word tempera- tures. The iv function does not in any way describe a condition which could be ti: t of a single system; it relates rather to many systems, to an en? The jelly adheres to the sphere and thus the adhering portions are forced to imitate the motion. The jet of air goes on spreading uniformly in all directions as it travels, in the course of which the velocity of the current grad- ually sinks to zero. The justi:fication of such a setting rests exclusively on the fact that, by means of such concepts and mental relations between them, we are able to orient ourselves in the labyrinth of sense impressions.
The justifica chology, physics treats directly only of are able to orient ourselves in the laby sense experiences and of the "under rinth of sense impressions.

The kind of electricity that the rod has in excess afterwards is called negative, a name which is certainly only a matter of convention. The kinetic and potential energy of a system to- gether constitute its mechanical energy. The kinetic energy of such electrons is given by R ? The kinetic theory of gases asserts that the average kinetic energy of an oscillator electron must be equal to the average kinetic energy of a translating gas molecule.
The kinetic theory of matter explains quantitatively as well as qualitatively the laws of gases as determined by experiment. The knowledge of truth as such is wonderful, but it is so little capable of acting as a guide that it cannot prove even the justifcation and the value of the aspiration towards that very knowledge of truth. The knowledge of truth as such is wonderful, but it is so little capable of acting as a guide that it cannot prove even the justification and the value of the aspiration toward that very knowledge of truth.

The large discordance is almost completely removed by Einstein's theory. The last and most successful creation of theoretical physics, namely quantum-mechanics, differs funda- mentally from both the schemes which we will for the sake of brevity call the Newtonian and the Max- wellian. The last drawing showed several velocity vectors representing the mo- tion at various points along the path. The last equation says that the states of the two systems are independent of each other. The last event is the coincidence of the stone with the earth. The last expression for t; is vindicated by t: i ) and (15). The last few years, nay, the last few days, have brought us a disappointment which must have touched you in particular nearly.
The last form follows from the first when we remember that a qf^^z=^^ , and therefore a g^^= -1. consequently g dg^^-^g^^ dg =0- From (28), it follows that (29) (T i 9. The last law holds even when there is the more special formulation, that with any arbitrary choice of the four-vector B alone the scalav product A B'^ B is a scalar, in which case we have the additional condition that A satisfies the symmetry condition. The last member of (B) can then be united with fiist of (A). The last of equations (47b) expresses the energy principle; s is the vector flow of energy, and ? The last of equations (53) thus yields \l"'g44 = "P .
The last paper in the present collection is a translation of a comprehensive article which he contributed to the Anualen der Physik in 1916 on this subject, and gives, in his own words, the Principles of Generalized Kelativity. The last war has shown that there are no longer any barriers between the continents and that the destinies of ali countries are closely interwoven. The last war has shown that there are no longer any barriers between the continents and that the destinies of all countries are closely interwoven. The last years, yes, even the last days, have brought us a disappointment which you in particular must feel keenly. The last-mentioned possibility commands especial interest.
The latest fundamental developments in quantum theory are concerned with a theoretical derivation of the quantum-theoretically possible states Zn and their weights pn. The latest pronouncements of the British Government indicate a return to a juster judgment of our case; this we recognize with gratitude. The latter ( hence also its '\jl function ) depends upon the point of view according to which this narrowing of the ensemble of systems is made. The latter amounts to this : A material point, which is acted on by no force, will be represented in four-dimensional space by a straight line, that is to say by a line that is as short as possible or more correctly, an extreme line.
The latter effect manifests itself in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light transmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with the position of the same spectral lines when they are produced by a terrestrial source of light (Doppler principle). The latter gave origin to certain generalized mathematical conditions with which the law of nature would bave to conform if the two fundamental principles were compatible. The latter is 3/2(R/N)T, while, according to the Wien formula, one obtains for the average magnitude of an energy quantum . The latter is directly connected with complexes of sense experiences. The latter is made clear by the followimg considerations.
The latter is only a special, limiting case of the Lorentz transformation when the relative velocities of two c.s. The latter presumes the validity of the former i as a limiting case and is its consistent continuation. The latter produces a Coriolis-force, acting transversely to the direction of the current, whose right-hand horizontal component amounts to 2 v O sin </> per unit of mass of the liquid, where v is the velocity of the current, O the speed of the earths rotation, and (f> the geographi- cal latitude. The latter quantity is not an invariant with respect to all the Lorentz transformations; the quantity s2 of equation (23) assumes the rTMle of this invariant.
The latter theory rather requires that the universe should have a kind of centre in which the density of the stars is a maximum, and that as we proceed outwards from this centre the group-density of the stars should diminish, until finally, at great distances, it is succeeded by an infinite region of emptiness. The latter too is based on a negative state? The latter, he remarked, are alterations which we can reverse by arbitrary motions of our bodies. The law expressing its direction and magnitude was extremely complicated. The law of aberration states that inthe :first approximation a = ,where e is the velocity of light. The law of causality has the sense of a definite statement about the world of experience only when observable facts alone appear as causes and effects.
The law of force simply had to be widened and adapted to the type of event under consideration. The law of inertia was his starting-point; if this is changed, so are all his further conclusions. The law of mass attraction which has been just describ- ed and which is formulated in accordance with the relativity postulate would signify that gravitation is propagated with the velocity of light. The law of mechanics of Galileo and Newton can be formulated only by using a system of co-ordinates. The law of motion of the mass point in a gravitational field had also to be adapted to the special theory of rela- tivity. The law of motion wi th respect to K1 results without difficulty from the following consideration.
The law of the conservation of the mass of a system becomes identical with the law of the conservation of energy, and is only valid provided that the system neither takes up nor sends out energy. The law of the constant velocity of light in empty space, which has been confirmed by the development of electro-dynamics and optics, and the equal legiti- macy of all inertial systems (special principle of relativity), which was proved in a particularly in- cisive manner by Michelsons famous experiment, between them made it necessary, to begin with, that the concept of time should be made relative, each inertial system being given its own special time. The law of the propagation of light in vacuo would then have to be replaced by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of relativity.
The law of transmission of light, the acceptance of which is justified by our actual knowledge, played an important part in this process of thought. The law says nothing, of course, as to wbether-or how-the disintegration reaction can be brought about. The laws GEXEllALISED TIIEOJJY OF RELATIVITY 135 of motion with reference to K, follow easily from the following consideration. The laws according to which the nature of physical systems alter are independent of the manner in which these changes are referred to two co-ordinate systems 6 PRINCIPLE or- RELATIVITY which have a uniform translatorv motion relative to each other. The laws connect the motion of the earth with the action of the far-off sun. The laws of conservation in the general case.
The laws of mechanics can be confirmed experimentally with the same degree of accuracy, on the earth or in a train or on a ship moving uniformly. The laws of nature must be invariant with respect to the Lorentz and not to the classical transformation. The laws of physics m1tst be of such a nature that they apply to systems of ref erence in any kind of motion. The laws of physics must be so constituted that they should remain valid for any system of co-ordinates moving in any manner. The laws of propagation thus seem to be different in the two frames and, hence, the relativity principle seems to be incompatible with the laws governing light's propagation. The laws of quantum physics are again structure laws. The laws of quantum physics are of a statistical character.
The laws of the mechanics of Galflei-Newton can be regarded as valid only for a Galileian system of co-ordinates. The laws of the mechanics of Galileo and Newton, for instance, can only be formulated with the aid of a co-ordinate system. The laws of transformation formulated here for co- ordinates and velocities we shall call the transforma- tion laws of classical mechanics, or more briefly, the classical transformation. The laws were clear and simple, the mechanical interpretations clumsy and contradictory. The layers are furthermore not clearly separated.
The learned societies of Germany have, however to the best of knowledge stood by and said nothing while a not inconsiderable proportion of German savants and students, and also of professional men of university education, have been deprived of all chance of getting employment or earning their livings in Germany. The leaves sepa- rate at once ! The left side of the equation is chosen in such a manner that its divergence disappears identically. The length of a stick may be 3 ft. 7 in. The length of the moving rod measured in the stationary system does not change, therefore, if v and ?v are interchanged. The length of the pole measured with the standard measuring-rod, combined with the specification of the position of the foot of the pole, supplies us with a complete place specification.
The length of the rod measured in K is therefore l/? The length to be discovered by the operation (b) we will call Othe length of the (moving) rod in the stationary system.O This we shall determine on the basis of our two principles, and we shall find that it differs from l. Current kinematics tacitly assumes that the lengths determined by these two operations are precisely equal, or in other words, that a moving rigid body at the epoch t may in geometrical respects be perfectly represented by the same body at rest in a definite position. The lengths of these three perpendiculars can be determined by a series of manipulations with rigid measuring-rods performed according to the rules and methods laid down by Euclidean geometry.
The leno-th which is foand out bv the second method, may be called * f^fe length of the moving rod 'measured from the sfatiomr^ si/dem/ This leni^th is to be estimated on the basis of our principle, and we shall find it to he different from I. The lessons of history-especially the very latest chapters-are all too plain on this score. The leuristic method of the special theory of rela- tivity is characterized by the following principle: Only those equations are admissible as an expres- sion of natural laws which do not change their form when the co-ordinates are changed by means of a Lorentz transformation (co-variance of equations in elation to Lorentz transformations).
The liber elementary concepts (concepts of the second layer), which are no longer di rectly connected with complexes of sense experiences. The liberty of choice, however, is of a special kind; it is not in any way similar to the liberty of a writer of :fiction. The lie was raised to the dignity of a politica! The life of the individual has meaning only in so far as it aids in making the life of every living thing nobler and more beautiful. The light emitted by the star when at the position A will be received by the observer after a time , while c + u ., the light emitted by the star when at the position B will be received after a time . The light from the sun is "white". The light gets weaker and weaker until it vanishes completely.
The light waves move through the ether just as the sound waves moved through the air. The limit c = oo corresponds to a com- plete folding up of the wedge-shaped cross-section between the fore and aft cones in the manifoldness / = 0. The line of development was as follows. The line of the orbit would not then be a closed one but in the course of time it would fill up an annular part of the orbital plane, viz. The line-element is defined by the four components d>' whose transformation law is expressed by the equation (5) dx! The lines in our space model are always perpen- dicular to the surface of the sphere. The lines of force are constructed in space, where no matter is present. The lines of force are directed from the positive to the negative pole.
The lions share in this revolution fell to Clerk Maxwell. The loaded cart will have a smaller final velocity than the empty one. The local times of all space points taken together are the **time," which belongs to the selected system of inertia, if a means is given to "set" these clocks relative to each other. The logical completeness of Newtons concep- tual system lay in this, that the only things that figure as causes of the acceleration of the masses of a system are these masses themselves. The logically simplest but also most daring method of achiev? The logically simplest but also most daring method of achieving this is a completely planned economy, in which consumption-goods are produced and distributed by the community.
The longer and the more despairingly I tried, the more I came to the convic- tion that only the discovery of a uni- versal formal principle could lead us to assured results. The longing for guidance, for love and succor, provides the stimulus for the growth of a social or moral conception of God. The longing to behold this pre-established har- mony is the source of the inexhaustible patience and endurance with which Planck has devoted himself, as we see, to the most general problems of our sci- ence, refusing to let himself be diverted to more grateful and more easily attained ends. The luminous gas of some element placed before a spectroscope shows lines of definite wave-length.
The mag- netic field created by the motion of the charge will be stronger if the charge is greater and if it moves faster. The mag- netic polarisation was looked upon as wholly secondary in origin, being due to the relative motion of the dielectric tubes of polarisation. The magistrate desires to remedy this abominable state of affairs, although all his counsellors and the rest of the citizens insist on continuing to carry a dagger in their girdles. The magnet is deflected by a perpendicular force. The magnetic needle turns from its previous position. The magnets and charges would rest near one another for an eternity if no external forces disturbed them. The magnit ude of the linear element pertaining to points of the four-dimensional continuum in infinite proximity, we call ds.
The main outstanding question was the following: does the ether participate in the motions of matter, or does the ether inside moving matter move differently or, perhaps, does the ether ignore the motions of matter and remain forever at rest? The main point seems rather to be this : The geometry of the Greeks prefers certain figures (the straight line, the plane) in geometrical descriptions; other figures (e.g., the ellipse) are only accessible to it because it constructs or defines them with the help of the point, the straight line and the pla^e. The main reason lies in the fact that it is not so easy to free oneself from the idea that coordinates rnust have an immediate metrical meaning.
The main source of the present-day confiicts between the spheres of religion and of science lies in this concept of a per? The main source of the present-day conflicts between the spheres of religion and of science lies in this concept of a personal God. The main value of the considerations we are presenting consists in that they point the way to a satisfactory treatment of gravitational mechanics. The majority of the stupid is invincible and guaranteed far ali time. The majority of those who are particularly dose to us are no longer among the living; Morris Cohen has been lately included in their number. The man who is possessed with it perishes sooner than it does.
The man who is thoroughly convinced of the universal operation of the law of causation cannot for a moment entertain the idea of a being who interferes in the course of events that is, if he takes the hypothesis of causality really seriously. The man who was not enthralled in youth by this work was not born to be a scientific theorist. The mani- foldness of the external situations and the narrowness of the momentary content of consciousness bring about a sort of atomizing of the life of every human being. The manifoldness of all possible values of x, y, z, t, will be the world. The many- particle system is expected to be represented by a regular solution of the field equations corresponding to a space of two identical sheets joined by many bridges.
The many-particle problem, v;hich would decide the value of the theory, has not yet been treated. The marvellous thing about the effect of his personality was this: Independent and headstrong natures, such as are particularly common among men of learning, do not readily bow to another's will and for the most part only accept his leadership grudgingly. The marvelous thing about the effect of bis personality was tls: lndependent and stubborn natures, such as are particularly co=on among men of Jearning, do not readily bow to another's will and for the most part only accept his leadership grudgingly.
The mass M of the molecule is assumed sufficiently large, so that higher powers of vjc can be neglected in comparison with lower ones; we can then apply the laws of ordinary mechanics to the molecule. The mass of a body is not a constant; it varies with changes in its energy.11 We see from the last of equations (43) that E becomes infinite when q approaches l, the velocity of light. The mass of insufficiently connected ex- perimental data was overwhelming here also. The mass, charge, and velocity of each in- dividual electron are known. The mast important method of education accordingly always has consisted af that in which the pupi!
The material bodies, which had led psychologically to our formation of the concept of the material point," had now themselves to be regarded as systems of material points. The material point coincides with a point on the scale on the rod, thus giving us a number deter- mining the position of this material point. The material point is our only mode of representing reality when dealing with changes taking place in it, the solitary representative of the real, in so far as the real is capable of change. The material point, therefore, can hardly be conceived any more as the basic concept of the theory. The mathe- IO-2 THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS matical simplicity of de Broglie's work, providing an answer to this question, is most astonishing.
The mathematical apparatus useful for the general relativity theory, lay already com- plete in the "Absolute Differential Calculus/' which were based on the researches of Gauss, Riemann and Christoffel on the tibn-EucHdean manifold, and which have been shaped into a system by Rieci and Levi-civita, and already applied to the problems of theoretical physics. The mathematical equations of this theory express the laws governing the electromagnetic field. The mathematical equivalence of the two methods was soon recognized by Schrodinger. The mathematical problem now solved so far is this: What are the simplest conditions to which a space-structure of the kind described can be sub- jected?
The mathematical results of the theory force one to this view, if one believes that the mean density of pon- derable matter in the wprld possesses some ultimate value, however small. The mathematics deal- ing with the problem of waves of matter is extremely simple and elementary but the fundamental ideas are deep and far-reaching. The matter of which geometry treats is first defined by the axioms. The mean displacement in one minute would be, therefore, about 6p. The mean displacement is therefore propor- tional to the square root of the time.
The meaning of (m^, Wg, 0)3, Wa) here is, that they are the ratios of da\, dx^, d ^, d,c^ to (20) V{^clc^^ + dx^ '-^ + d.c3 2 + dx^ =^ =dt Vl u\ The differentials donoting the displacements of matter occupying the spacetime point (.f.^, .i^g^ -^'3; '^u) ^^ ^^le adjacent space-time point. The meaning of Zionism is thus many-sided. The meaning of the dotted vector is clear; it represents the change in velocity for which, as we know, the push is responsible.
The means hitherto at our disposal, for placing our co-ordinate system in the time-space continuum, in a GENERALISED THEORY OP RELATIVITY 1^7 definite way, therefore completely fail and it appears that there is no other way which will enable us to fit the co-ordinate sjstem to the four-dimensional world in such a way, that by it we can expect to get a specially simple formulation of the laws of Nature. The measurements of the rotation of the earth reveals a fundamental framework which may be called the ^' inertial framework."
The mechanical behavior of a corporeal system floating freely in empty space de- pends not only on the relative positions (intervals) and velocities of its masses, but also on its state of rotation, which cannot be regarded physically speak- ing as a property belonging to the system as such. The mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously considered, and for this reason it would appear to be impossible that the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving carriage, as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in uniform motion. The mechanical properties of the ether were at first a mystery. The mechanics of a system is determined if its potential energy is given as a function of its configura_:?
The mechanism of one of his experi- ments is very much like that of a weight clock. The medical faculty is first of all to be developed as a research institute and to concentrate on making the country healthy, a most important item in the work of development. The men of learning have become representatives of tbe most extreme national traditions and lost their sense of an intellectual commonwealtb. The men of learning have become the chief mouthpieces of national tradition and lost their sense of an intellectual commonwealth. The mental grasp of this extra-personal world within the frame of the given possibilities swam as the highest aim half consciously and half unconsciously before my mind's eye.
The mercury gets hot much more quickly than the water, showing that less "heat" is needed to raise the temperature by one degree. The merit of constructive theories is their comprehen? The metal rests on glass or some other insulator so that the fluid remains on the conductor, as long as the conductivity of the air permits. The method bitherto employed for laying co-ordinates into the space-time continuum in a definite manner thus breaks down, and there seems to be no other way which would allow us to adapt systems of co-ordinates to the four-dimensional universe so that we might expect from their application a particularly sinlple formulation of the laws of nature.
The method of Cartesian coordinates must then be discarded, and replaced by another which does not assume the validity of Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies. The method of reasoning dictated by intui- tion was wrong and led to false ideas of motion which were held for centuries. The metrically real is now only given through the combination of the space-time co-ordinates with the mathematical quantities which describe the gravita- tional field. The minds oE the people must, above ali, be prepared for it. The minimum of pressure, or, respectively, the maximum of the scalar of curvature, does not change with time in the mterior of the corpuscle. The model is analogous to that of a gravitational field (p. 130) because of the similarity between Coulomb's law and Newton's.
The modem prejudice against Negroes is the result of the desire to maintain this unworthy condition. The modern quantum theory in the form associated with the names of de Broglie, Schrodinger, and Dirac, which operates with continuous functions, has overcome these difficulties by a bold piece of inter- pretation which was first given a clear form by Max Born. The modern quantum theory, as associated with the names of de Broglie, Schr6dinger, and Dirac, which of course operates with continuous functions, has overcome this difficulty by means of a daring interpretation, first given in a clear form by Max Born:-the space functions which appear in the equations make no claim to be a mathematical model of atomic objects.
The modification to which the special theory of relativity has subjected the theory of space and time is indeed far? The modification which the theory of space and time has undergone through the special relativity theory, is indeed a profound one, but a weightier point remains untouched. The moment the current began to flow a new force appeared, acting on the magnetic pole, and perpendicular to any line connect- ing the wire and the pole. The moment the war was over, he joined the governing body of the "Conseil de recherche," which was founded by the savants of the victorious countries, and from which the savants and learned societies of the Central Powers were excluded. The momentum Mv of a molecule undergoes two different types of change during the short time interval x.
The momentum of the system af ter absorption is then M'v. The moral authority of the UN would be considerably enhanced if the delegates were elected directly by the people. The moral element cannot be displaced by reason, thank heaven ! The more I feel an American, the more this situation pains me. The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of ali events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room lef t by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.

The more modern interpretation: Geometry treats of entities which are denoted by the words straight line, point, etc. The more modern interpretation:Geometry treats of entities which are denoted by the words straight line, point, etc. The more social attitude of the individual, which I mentioned just now, makes this possible here. The more violet was the light, the greater was the velocity of emission. The more we read, the more fully do we appreciate the perfect construction of the book, even though a complete solution seems to recede as we ad- vance.
The more, however, we turn to the most primitive concepts of everyday life, the more difficult it becomes amidst the mass of inveterate habits to recognize the concept as an independent creation of thinking. The more, however, we turo to the most primitive concepts of everyday life, tl1e more difficult it becomes amidst tl1e mass of inveterate habits to recognize tl1e concept as an independent creation of tl1inking. The most beautiful experience we can have is the mystericus. The most conspicuous practical effect of science is that it makes possible the contriving of things that enrich life, though they complicate it at the same time-inventions such as the steam engine, the railway, electric power and light, the telegraph, radio, automobile, airplane, dynamite, etc.
The most deadly foes of Jewish national consciousness and Jewish national dignity are fatty degeneration a lack of racial consciousness which is a result of excessive wealth and comfort and a certain sort of inner dependence upon the non- Jewish environment, a dependence proceeding from the increased laxity of Jewish communal authority. The most difficult point for such a field-theory at present is how to include the atomic structure of matter and energy. The most diverse experiments were performed without detecting the expected dependence of phenomena on orientation. The most evident difference springs from the important part which is played in man by a relatively strong power of imagination and by the capacity to think, aided as it is by language and other symbolical devices.
The most fascinating subject at the time that I was a student was Maxwell's theory. The most fundamental concepts in the description of heat phenomena are temperature and heat. The most im- portant point, however, is this: these laws are con- cerned with the movement as a whole, and not with the question how the state of motion of a system gives rise to that which immediately follows it in time; they are, as we should say now, integral and not dif- ferential laws. The most imp0rtant fact that we draw from experience as to the distribution of matter is that the relative velocities of the stars are very small as compared with the velocity of light. The most important method of education accordingly al?

The most important motive for work in the school and in life is the pleasure in work, pleasure in its result and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community. The most important of these experiments are those of Michelson and Morley, which I shall assume are known. The most important point of contact between Gauss's theory of surfaces and the general theory of relativity lies in the metrical properties upon which the concepts of both theories, in the main, are based. The most important result of a general character to which the special theory of relativity has led is concerned with the conception of mass.
The most important result of the special relativity system concerned the inert mass of a materiai system. The most important upshot of the special theory of relativity concerned the inert mass of corporeal systems. The most natural elementary charged particle is found to be one of zero mass. The most noticeable change was a new law of mo? The most obvious line to adopt in the face of this situation seemed to be the following: There is no such thing as the ether. The most satisfactory situation is evidently to be found in cases where the new fundamental hypotheses are suggested by the world of experience itself.
The most unsatisfactory side of this system (apart from the difficulties involved in the concept of abso- lute space which have been raised once more quite recently) lay in its description of light, which Newton also conceived, in accordance with his system, as composed of material points. The motion along the rigid rod (the tower), the motion in a one-dimensional space, is here represented as a curve in a two-dimensional time-space continuum. The motion of a railway train is described with reference to the ground, of a planet with reference to the total assemblage of visible :fxed stars.
The motion of clocks is also influenced by gravitational fields, and in such a way that a physical definition of time which is made directly with the aid of clocks has by no means the same degree of plausibility as in the special theory of relativity. The motion of the wave is very different from that of the particles of water. The motion we observe is again relative. The motions of the moon, the earth and the planets, just those to which the principles of mechanics have been applied with such brilliant success, are motions along curved paths. The motive power for the ship is, as I said, provided by the wind alone. The movement of a ve- hicle is considered in reference to the earth's surface, that of a planet to the totality of the visible fixed stars.
The moving force of the mass- point F in the space-time point B is now the space- time vector of the first kind which is normal to BC, and which is composed of the vectors 3 (24) mm^f^^'^] BD"^ in the direction of BD^ and another vector of suitable value in direction of B'^C"^. The multitude of layers discussed above corresponds to the severa} stages of progress which have resulted from the struggle for unity in the course of development. The name "theory of relativity" is connected with the fact that motion from the point of view of possible experience always appears as the relative motion of one object with respect to another ( e.g., of a car with respect to the ground, or the earth with respect to the sun and the fixed stars).
The names plus and minus are only a matter of convention, but when once fixed, enable us to designate poles in any other case. The nations united in the League had further outlawed as criminal the method of solving conflicts by means of war. The natural philosophers of those days were, on the contrary, most of them possessed with the idea that the fundamental concepts and postulates of physics were not in the logical sense free inventions of the human mind but could be deduced from ex- perience by abstraction that is to say by logical means.
The natural remedies for our troubles are, in my opinion, as follows: (1) A statutory reduction of working hours, graduated for each department ofindustry, in order to get rid of unemployment, combined with the fixing of minimum wages for the purpose of adjusting the purchasing-power of the masses to the amount of goods available. The natural remedies of our troubles are, in my opinion, as fallows: (I) A statntory reduction of working hours, graduated far each department of industry, in arder to get rid of unemploy? The natural sciences, and in particular, the most fundamental of them, physics, deal with such sense perceptions.
The nature of acceleration of an infinitely small (posi- tional) co-ordinate system is hereby to be so chosen, that the gravitational field does not apipear; this is possible for an infinitely small region. The nature of the complexes and sense-impressions which are probably responsible for that concept has often been described. The nearer a velocity is to that of light the more difficult it is to increase. The necessity of introducing many different kinds of force for different events is certainly unsatisfactory from a philosophical point of view. The neglected clue is connected with one of the fundamental concepts of mechanics that of mass. The net effect on the piston of all these small irregular forces must be equal to that of the force of gravity if there is to be equilibrium.
The neutral, as well as the electrical, particle is a portion of space connecting the two sheets (bridge). The new clue found by Galileo is : if a body is neither pushed, pulled, nor acted on in any other way, or, more briefly, if no external forces act on a body, it moves uniformly, that is, always with the same velocity along a straight line. The new clue starts from an analysis of the most fundamental and primitive concepts; we shall show how this analysis forces us to change our old views and removes all our difficulties. The new concepts originated in connection with the phenomena of electricity, but it is simpler to introduce them, for the first time, through mechanics.
The new concepts prove very successful and help us to understand the motion of a thrown stone as well as that of the planets. The new general laws valid for all c.s. The new quantum physics removes us still further from the old mechanical view, and a retreat to the former position seems, more than ever, unlikely. The new theory of gravitation diverges consider- ably, as regards principles, from Newton's theory. The new theory shows the merits as well as the limitations of the old theory and allows us to regain our old concepts from a higher level. The next assumption of the theory is that two electric fluids of the same kind repel each other, while two of the opposite kind attract. The next drawing shows how this phenomenon is connected with the rectilinear propagation of light.
The next example of a quantity independent of the c.s. The next figure shows vectors all different, because they differ either in length or direction, or both. The next position which it was possible to take up in face of this state of things appeared to be the following. The next question would be: upon what does this force depend? The next step is the introduction of the change in velocity of a particle moving along a curve. The next step is to consider some conclusions contradicting the Galilean relativity principle and supporting the view of motion through ether, and to put them to the test of an experiment.
The next step is to investigate the space-time behaviour of the gravitational field G, which was derived from the Galileian special case simply by transformation of the coordinates. The next step was taken by De Broglie. The non-depeudence of aberration on the '" absolute " velocity it, is also very easily explained with the help of this Fi-esnelian convection- coefficient k. Stokes^ viseous ether.It should be remembered, however, that Fresnel 's stationary ether is absolutelv fixed and is not at all disturbed bv the motion of matter throusfh it. The non-divisibility of the four-dimensional continuum of events does not at all, however, involve the equivalence of the space co-ordinates with the time co-ordinate.
The non-mathematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering when he hears of "fourdimensional" things, by a feeling not unlike that awakened by thoughts of the occult. The notion "materiai point" is fundamental for me? The notion of co-ordinates defined above, which pre? The number determining its position on the upper c.s. The number expressing the velocity of light appears explicitly in the Lorentz transformation, and plays the role of a limiting case, like the infinite velocity in classical mechanics. The number just quoted concerns the velocity of light in vacuo.
The number of configurations, of which we were just speaking, can be thought of as expressing the multiplicity of the distribution possibilities of the total energy among N resonators, if every imaginable distribution of energy approached within some approximation of the calculated number of configurations W. This requires that the energy be small compared to average resonator energy E for all . The number of lines offeree passing through the surface surrounded by the wire changed very rapidly. The number of molecules in one gram of hydro- gen is 303,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. The number of molecules whose energy lies within the elementary interval dEs is therefore, by virtue of (8), given by (11b) in accordance with the classical theory.
The number of our friends is not great, but among them are men of lofty spirit and righteousness who have devoted their lives to ennobling the human race and to the liberation of individuals from degrading oppression. The number of such configurations that result in the given total energy is calculated and set equal to W. From Wien's displacement law, which can be derived from thermodynamic principles, Planck concluded that must be set equal to h, where h is independent of . The number of such processes per second is thus really ^> B exp(-a/ar)B^>') * For each such elementary process a momentum cos <p' gets transmitted to the atom in the direction of the positive X'-axis. The number of these operations required is the numerical measure of the distance AB.
The object of all science, whether natural science or psychology, is to co-ordinate our experiences and to bring them into a logical system. The object which the leaders of Zionism have in view is not a political but a social and cultural one. The objection that we Jews cannot be proper citizens of the German State, for example, if we want to be a "nation," is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the State which springs from the intolerance of national majorities. The objective of avoiding total destruction must have priority over any other objective. The obligation to pay reparations lies heavy on the debtor nations and their economies.
The obligation to pay reparations lies heavy on the debtornations and their industries, compels them to go in for dumping, and so harms the creditor nations too This is beyond dispute. The observable economic facts belong to that phase and even such laws as we can derive from them are not applicable to other phases. The observable economie facts belong to that phase and even such laws as we can derive from them are not applicable to other phases. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion.
The observations of the sun and Mars at these moments thus constitute a means of determining the true orbit of the earth, as Mars then plays the part of our imaginary lantern. The observed deflection is decisively in favour of the Generalised Theory of Relativity. The observed fleets had become too contradictory and too heterogeneous to be reduced to an organised whole with the help of the ether concept alone. The observed motion is thus the result of the unobservable one. The observed motion of the wave is that of a state of matter and not of matter itself.
The observed phenomena in this case depend only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, while according to the usual conception, a distinction must be made between the cases where the one or the other of the bodies is in motion. The observer at the common origin of co-ordinates who is able to see the clock at the periphery by means of light will see the clock at the periphery going slower than the clock beside him. The observer in each of the two c.s. The observer in the room claims: the velocity of sound is, for me, the same in all directions. The observer performs experiments on his circular disc with clocks and measuring-rods.
The observer will further convince himself that the acceleration of the body towards the floor of the chest is always of the same magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the experiment. The observer, when he seems to himself to be observing a stone, is really, if physics is to be believed, observing the effects of the stone upon himself. The observers in the room are no longer talking, but are sending light signals, or light waves in every direction. The old mechanical view attempted to reduce all events in nature to forces acting between material par- ticles. The old mechanics is valid for small velocities and forms the limiting case of the new one.
The old names, latent heat of melting or vaporization, show that these concepts are drawn from the picture of heat as a substance. The old physicist bothers only about space transformation, as time is absolute for him. The old question about the oscillation direction of polarized light became irrelevant. The old theory is a special limiting case of the new one. The older interpretation: Every one knows what a straight line is, and what a point is. The older interpretation:Every one knows what a straight line is, and what a point is. The omission of a word from our vocabulary is, of course, no remedy. The one guarantee of security is an undertaking by all nations to give effect to the decisions of the international authority.
The one in the medium of language, the other in the medium of melody, expresses perfectly with almost superhuman precision, the message of his art and his soul. The only apparatus necessary for observing Brownian motion is a microscope, which need not even be a particularly good one. The only difference between the two models is that the arrows point in opposite direc- tions. The only difference is that change of velocity has now a broader meaning than before. The only effective help that can be given the Jewish people in these eastern lands is to throw open to them the new fields of vocational activity for which they are striving all over the world. The only hope for protection lies in the securing of peace in a supranational way.
The only justification for our concepts and system of concepts is that they serve to represent the complex of our experiences; beyond this they have no legitimacy. The only physical significance of the probability wave is that it enables us to answer sensible statistical questions in the case of many par- ticles as well as of one. The only possible answer seems to result from the following consideration: If the man were to stand still for a second, he would advance relative to the embankment through a distance v equal numerically to the velocity of the carriage. The only rational way of educating is to be an example of what to avoid, if one can't be the other sort. The only rational way of educating is to be an example-if one can't help it, a warning example.
The only real step toward world government is world gov? The only reason why we must wait for a total eclipse is because at every other time the atmosphere is so strongly illuminated by the light from the sun that the stars situated near the sun's disc are invisible. The only recourse left open is to alter the measure of time as well, that is, to adopt the concept of "local time." The only signifi- cant reason for dividing the physical process into these two aspects is to make possible the use of the concepts previously discussed. The only statements having regard to these points which can claim a physical existence are in reality the statements about their encounters.
The only thing I did was this: in Jong intervals I have expressed an opinion on public issues whenever they appeared to me so bad and unfortunate that silence would have made me feel guilty of complicity. The only thing to which I take exception there is the bad intellectual conscience which shines through between the lines. The only useful and fundamentally basic theory was that of Lorentz, which depended on a completely immobile ether. The only way of really helping the Jew in Eastern countries is to give him access to new fields of activity, for which he is struggling all over the world. The only way out is to abandon the Galilean relativity principle and try out the assumption that all bodies move through the calm ether-sea.
The operation shall be called a general Lorentz transformation. The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, contraction and differentiation for these tensors are wholly analogous to the corresponding operations for tensors in three-dimensional space. The operator corresponding to it, say g, is the operator of multiylication by the independent variable. The opinion prevailed among advanced minds that it was time that belief should be replaced increas? The opinion prevailed among advanced minds that it was time that belief should be replaced increasingly by knowledge; belief that did not itself rest on knowledge was superstition, and as such had to be opposed.
The opinion which I entertained until recently, as to the limiting conditions to be laid down in spatial infinity, took its stand on the following considerations. The opportunity is presented to us of setting up centres of civilization which the whole Jewish people can regard as its work. The opposite extreme is illustrated by over-populated China or India, where the low price of labour has stood in the way of the development of machinery. The optical experiments of the last quarter of the nine- teenth century showed the impossibility of constructing a simple ether theory, which would be jsmenable to analytic treatment and would at the same time stimulate funher progress.
The orbita.I ellipse of a planet undergoes a slow rotation, in the direction of motion, of amount a2 E = 247r3T2c2(1 - e2) (75) per revolution. The orbits were empirically known, but their laws had to be deduced from the empirical data. The ordinary idea of simultaneity rather presupposes that six independent parameters, which are evidently required for defining a system of space and time axes, are somehow reduced to three. The ordinary objects of human endeavour property, outward success, luxury have always seemed to me contemptible. The original features of the picture of the field we formed from Oersted's and Faraday's experiments are still preserved, but we now recognize that it has a deeper meaning. The original term is retained as there is no snitable English equivalent.
The originality of Einstein at this stage consists in his successful physical interpretation of these results, and viewing them as the coherent organised consequences of a single general principle. The orthodox Maxwellian view located the dielectric polarisation in the electromagnetic ether which was merely a transformation of Fresnel's stag-nant ether. The oscillation of the charge produces a changing electric field. The oscillation theory, in its present formulation, gives no answers to these questions. The other is special, and states the exact dependence of the particular kind of force involved on the distance be- tween the bodies. The other man might choose to start a rival enterprise, when what is wanted is his coopera?
The other pole is far enough away for the force acting upon it to be negligible. The other two may be combined, and together, by (31), tbey give (J3gafl - t x.. x x,.' The outcome of repeated experiments must again be dark and light rings for one hole and dark and light stripes for two. The outcome of such deduction is the electromagnetic wave. The outside observer claims : the velocity of sound, spreading in the moving room and determined in my c.s., is not the same in all directions. The outside observer will represent the standard c.s., designated by the ether-sea. The outside observer: In my system, the velocity of light is exactly the same as in that of the observer moving with the room.
The over-estimation of money is still greater in this country than in Europe, but appears to me to be on the decrease. The overcoming of na1ve realism has been relatively simple. The overcoming of naive realism has been Telatively simple. The overestimation of money is stil! The owner of the means of production is in a position to purchase the labor power of the worker. The paper of Einstein which has been cited in the Introduction, has succeeded to some extent in presenting the nature of the transformation from the physical standpoint. The part of passive spectator is unworthy of this country and is bound in the end to lead to disaster all round. The part which the new ether is destined to play in the physical scheme of the future is still a matter of uncertainty.
The participation of matter in electromagnetic phenomena has its origin only in the fact that the elementary particles of matter carry unalter? The particle moves along the curve, from left to right, under the influence of ex- ternal forces. The particle- charges create the field, which, on the other hand, exerts forces upon the charges of the particles, thus de- termining the motion of the latter according to Newton's law of mo- tion. The particles are now packed more closely. The particles constitut- ing the medium perform only small vibrations, but the whole motion is that of a progressive wave. The particles merely go up and down. The particles of liquid in most rapid motion will be farthest away from the walls, that is to say, in the upper part above the center of the bottom.
The particles of the medium in the immediate vicinity of the sphere are pushed out, so that the density of a spherical shell ofwater, or air, as the case may be, is increased above its normal value. The particles of the medium oscillate along short line segments, and the density increases and decreases periodically in accordance with this motion. The passions of nationalism have destroyed tbis commu? The passions of nationalism have destroyed this community of the intellect, and the Latin language, which once united the whole world, is dead. The path was not so unmistakably marked out here, since the inert mass of a body might depend on the gravitational potential.
The paths are quite different, as also are the velocities, but the change in velocity has the same direction, that is, toward the centre of the earth. The peculiar type of mechanical interpretation of these fields remained in the background- a sort of placation of the scientifc conscience in view of the mechanical tradition of Faraday's time. The peculiarity of these equations lies, on the one hand, in their com- plicated construction, especially their non-linear character as regards the field -variables and their derivatives, and, on the other hand, in the almost compelling necessity with which the transformation-group determines this complicated field-law. The people of this country must realize that they have a great responsibility in the sphere of international politics.
The phase space volume belonging to a certain domain of coordinates x,y,z and conjugate momenta px,py,pz of a monoatomic molecule is expressed by the integral. The phenom- enon of aberration also lent support to the theory of the quasi-rigid ether. The phenomenological representation of matter is, in fact, only a crude substitute for a representation which would correspond to all known properties of matter. The phenomenon is reduced to the motion ofparticles which, according to the kinetic theory, are constituents of 1O*J matter. The phenomenon of aberration also favoured the theory of the quasi-rigid ether.
The phenomenon of distinct shadow, that is, the phenomenon of rectilinear propagation of light, is observed in nature only because all apertures and obstacles ordinarily met with are extremely large in comparison with the wave-lengths of light. The phenomenon of the propagation of light in empty space assigns a tract, namely, the appropriate path of light, to each interval of local time, and conversely. The photons emitted correspond to many energies and not to one only. The phys- ical world is represented as a four-dimensional con- tinuum. The physical interpretation of the spatial coordinates presupposed a fixed body of reference, which, moreover, had to be in a more or less definite state of motion (inertial sys- tem).
The physical laws are now expressed by means of <', y, ^, i' , and the expressions are just the same as in the case of <<, y^ z, t. According to this, we shall have in the world, not one space, but many spaces, quite analogous to the case that the three-dimensional space consists of an infinite number of planes. The physical laws should be applied to Copernicus' c.s. The physical quan- tities describing the oscillating cord and the radiating atom have quite a different meaning, despite some formal likeness in the equations.

The physical significance of these ojierations will 184 PKINCIPLK OF RELATIVITY beeomo elfar when alono; witli ]\[inko\vh^ki's mfithod of treatment we also study the geometrical method of Sommerfeld. The physical world is represented as a four-dimensionalcontinuum. The physicist is concerned with the question as to whether the theorems of geometry are true or not. The physicist of the present generation regards the point of view achieved by Lorentz as the only possible one; at that time, however, it was a surprising and audacious step, without which the later development would not have been possible. The physicists of our time are mostly not fully aware of the decisive part which H. A. Lorentz played in shaping the fundamental ideas in theoretical physics.
The physicists renunciation of completeness for his cosmos is therefore not a matter of fundamental principle. The physicists were far long unable to account for this kind of heat "production." The physicists were thereupon persuaded that the conservation principle could be further extended to take in chemical and electromagnetic processes-in short, could be applied to all field It appeared that in our physical system there was a sum total of energies that remained constant through all changes that might occur. The picture of heat "flowing" from one body to an- other suggests itself, like water flowing from a higher level to a lower.
The picture was, then, as follows: Space is filled by the ether, in which the material corpuscles or atoms of ponderable matter swim ; the atomic structure of the latter had been securely established by the turn of the century. The plain meaning of the experiment is that both arms have a length I when placed along 0^ (perpendicular to the direc- tion of motion), and automatically contract to a length Ijpf when placed along 0/ (parallel to the direction of motion). The plane is therefore infinite in relation to the cardboard squares. The planets, for example, travel through the ether-jelly without encountering any resistance such as a material medium would offer to their motion. The plate then shows the diffraction pattern.
The point is to develop tbe childlike inclination for play and the childlike desire for recognition and to guide tbe child over to important fields for society; it is tbat education which inthe mam is founded upon the desire for successful activity and acknowledgment. The point, the plane, the straight line, length, are solid objects idealized. The points of this hyper-surface form a three-dimensional continuum, a spherical space of radius of curvature R. The four-dimensional Euclidean space with which we started serves only for a convenient definition of our hyper? The points on the axis do not move, and only a very small displacement takes place nearby.
The politica !and economie confilcts and complexities of the last few decades have brought before our eyes dangers which even the darkest pessimists of the last century did not dream of. The political organization of Europe must be strengthened, and a gradual attempt made to abolish tariff barriers. The population of the civilized countries is extremely dense as compared with former times; Europe to-day contains about three times as many people as it did a hundred years ago. The population of the civilized countries is extremely dense as compared with former times; Europe today contains about three times as many people as it did a hundred years ago. The posing of the problem seems, however, entirely reasonable.
The position of a material point is characterized, at this moment, by the same number in both c.s. The position of affairs here is almost the same as when the Principle of Conservation of Energy was poslutated in cases, where the corresponding forms of energy were unknown. The position of our scattered Jewish community is a moral barometer for the political world. The position of such a metric in a three-dimensional continuum is fully equivalent to the positions of the axioms of Euclidean geometry. The position of the end-point of the lamp, if the lamp is at rest, can be described by three numbers: two of them determine the distance from two perpendicular walls, and the third that from the floor or ceiling.
The position of two material points in space, at any moment, is cha- racterized by six numbers, three for each of the points. The positions relative to the body of reference (railway carriage or embankment) have already been defined in detail in the preceding section. The positions, or co-ordinates, and velocities are examples of quantities which are different in different c.s. The possession of marvellous means of production has brought care and hunger instead of freedom. The possibility ( b) holds out no hope of solving the prob?
The possibility of explaining the numerical equality of inertia and gravitation by the unity of their nature gives to the general theory of relativity, according to my conviction, such a superiority over the conceptions of classical mechanics, that all the difficulties encountered must be considered as small in comparison with this progress. The possibility of replacing skew-symmetrical tensors of the second rank in space of three dimensions by vectors depends upon the formation of the vector A = A?? The possibility of solving these difficulties depends on the answer to the following question: Can we formulate physical laws so that they are valid for all c.s., not only those moving uniformly, but also those moving quite arbitrarily relative to each other?
The possibility of such a connection is suggested both by our tentatively accepted philosophical point of view and by the way in which heat is generated by motion. The possibility of the quasi rigid continu? The possibility of the realization of this program was, however, dubious from the very first, because the theory had to combine the following things: (1) From the general considera- tions of special relativity theory it was clear that the inert mass of a physical system increases with the total energy (therefore, e.g., with the ki- netic energy).
The possibility presents itself that the law of the propagation of light in vacuo may be compatible with the principle of relativity, and the question arises: How have we to modify the considerations of Section 6 in order to remove the apparent disagreement between these two fundamental results of experience? The possibility should not be excluded, however, that electrons might receive their energy only in part from the light quantum. The potential energy increases with the elevation, while the kinetic energy becomes greater as the velocity increases. The potential energy of the weights has changed into kinetic energy of the mechanism, and has then gradually been dissipated as heat.
The potential energy of the weights was changed into kinetic energy of the movable parts, and thence into heat which raised the temperature of the water. The potential of the copper turns out to be higher than that of the zinc. The power of conscience and the international spirit has proved itself inadequate. The power of every state over its citizens has grown steadily during the last few hundred years, no less in countries where the power of the state has been exercised wisely, than in those where it has been used for brutal tyranny. The power of this world government would be over all military matters, and there need be only one further power. The power that one country possesses today, tomorrow will belong also to others.
The practical joker installs some mechanism which enables him to cause the entire room to rotate quickly on an axis passing through its centre. The practical possibility of achieving it, on the other hand, has only existed for a few decades to be exact, since we have possessed usable small motors. The practice, for example, of seeing in a "distance" two marked positions on a practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our habit of thought. The precise formulation of the time-space laws of those fields was the work of Maxwell. The predicted effect can be seen clearly from the accompanying diagram. The predicted magnitude: a complete rotation in three million years.
The predominantly inductive methods appropriate to the youth of science are giving place to tentative deduction. The prejudice N which has by no means died out in the meantime N consists in the faith that facts by themselves can and should yield scientific knowledge without free conceptual construction. The presence of such a geometrical force is usually interpreted us being due to the adoption of a fictitious framework. The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.
The present deplorably high development of nationalism everywhere is, in my opinion, intimately connected with the institution of compulsory military service or, to call it by its less offensive name, national armies. The present dif!culties of his science farce the physicist to come to grips with philosophical problems to a greater degree than was the case with earlier generations. The present difficulties of his science force the physicist to come to grips with philosophical problems to a greater degree than was the case with earlier generations. The present difficulty cannot be solved by any further alteration in the measure of space. The present impasse lies in the fact that there is no su:fficient, reliable supranational authority.
The present method of selection by govemment appoinhnent does not leave any real freedom to the appointee. The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the Prohibition law. The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the Prohibition laws. The presupposition of the existence (in principle) of (ideal, viz., perfect) measuring rods and clocks is not in- dependent of each other; since a lightsignal, which is reflected back and forth between the ends of a rigid rod, constitutes an ideal clock, provided that the postulate of the constancy of the light-velocity in vacuum does not lead to contradic- tions.
The price which must be paid for abandoning the language of mathe- matics is a loss in precision, and the necessity of some- times quoting results without showing how they were reached. The priests, in contrai of edu? The priests, in control of education, made the class division of society into a permanent institution and created a system of values by which the people were thenceforth, to a large extent unconsciously, guided in their social behavior. The primary duty of an Academy is to encourage and protect the scientific life of a country. The primitive subjective feeling of time flow enables us to order our impressions, to judge that one event takes place earlier, another later. The principal guess is that the uniformly moving electron will behave, in some phenomena, like a wave.
The principal vehicle of this tradition is military training and its glorification, and, equally, that portion of the Press which is controlled by heavy industry and the soldiers. The principle of energy must apply to this process, and in fact (by the principle of relativity) with respect to both systems of co-ordinates. The principle of equivalence demands that in dealing with Galilean regions we may equally well make use of non-inertial systems, that is, such co-ordinate systems as, relatively to inertial systems, are not free from acceleration and rotation. The principle of inertia, in particular, seems to compel us to ascribe physically objective properties to the space-time continuum.
The principle of inertia, the law of conservation of energy were gained only by new and original thoughts about already well-known experiments and phenomena. The principle of its construction is simple. The principle of relativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the domain of mechanics. The principle of relativity requires that the law of the concervation of energy should hold not only with reference to a co-ordinate system K, but also with respect to every co-ordinate system K1 which is in a state of uniform motion of translation relative to K, or, briefly, relative to every " Galileian " system of co-ordinates. The principle of the conserva- tion of mass lost its independence and became fused with that of the conservation of energy.
The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light then states that this adjustment of the clocks will not lead to contradictions. The principle of the equality of iner- tial and gravitational mass could now be formulated quite clearly as follows: In a homogeneous gravi- tational field all motions take place in the same way as in the absence of a gravitational field in relation to a uniformly accelerated co-ordinate system. The principle of the experiment may be illustrated by considering a swimmer in a river. The principle we have made use of not only maintains that we may equally well choose the carriage or the embankment as our reference-body for the description of any event (for this, too, is self-evident). The principles of mechanics suffice to explain the motion.
The pro:fit motive, in conjunction with competi? The probabilities pr belonging to the s-th cell then obviously are functions of the cell number s and of the integer index r, and shall thus henceforth be denoted more explicitly as. The probability of a macroscopically defined state (in the sense of Planck) is equal to the number of the different microscopic states through which the macroscopic state can be thought to be realized. The probability wave forms the catalogue of our knowledge of the quantum system under considera- tion and will enable us to answer all sensible statistical questions concerning this system.
The probability wave is, at a given in- stant, a function of a three-dimensional continuum, whereas, in the case of the cord the deviation was, at a given moment, a function of the one-dimensional con- tinuum. The problem is thereby reduced to that of determining E as a function of T. However, the latter problem can also be reduced to the following. The problem of formulating physical laws for every c.s. The problem of gravitation was thus reduced to a mathematical problem: it was required to find the simplest fundamental equations which are co-variant in relation to any transformation of co-ordinates whatever. The problem with which the intellectuals of this country are confronted is very serious.
The process of development here sketched strips the space-time co-ordinates of all independent reality. The process of interchanging personnel would further lessen the danger of surprise attacks and in itself would lay the psychological foundation for intemationalization of military resources. The process should be just the reverse of the previous one. The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions.
The progress achieved by axiomatics consists in its having neatly separated the logical formal from its objective or intuitive content; according to axiomatics the logical-formal alone forms the subject-matter of mathematics, which is not concerned with the intuitive or other content associated with the logical-formal.

The progress in method which electro-dynamics owes to the theory of special relativity lies principally in this, that the number of independent hypotheses is diminished. The progress of events so far scarcely justifies us in hoping for anything better in the near future. The progress of science has destroyed the older con- cept of heat as a substance. The progress of science in our century will be highly appre? The progress of technological development has not increased the stability and the welfare of humanity. The proof Jies in this, that ds is an invariant as well as d</J.
The proof follows from as the fact that d<f> as well as ds, are both invariants Since d(f> __ 6 <^ At ds Qx Q s so that i/a= ~ ' ~- is also an invariant for all curves OX ds ^hich go out from a point in the continuum, i.e., for any choice of the vector d.c . The proof follows from the equation defining tensors. The proof follows with the aid of the theorem proved above b?? The proof is quite similar, The law can also be put in,the following from. The proof that energy is not weightless can be gained in many very conclusive, but indirect, ways. The proof that the result of contraction really possesses the tensor character is given either by the representation of a tensor according to the generalization of (12) in combination with (6), or by the generalization of (13).
The properties of the field alone appear to be essential for the description of phenomena; the differences in source do not matter. The properties of this physical universe may be referred to some world-distribution of matter or the "inertial frame- work" may be constructed by a suitable modification of the law of gravitation itself. The proposed militarization of the nation not only immedi? The prosperity was, taken as a whole, modest but sufficient; the tradition of respect for culture vigorous. The province of scientifically determined fact has been enormously extended, theoretical knowledge has become vastly more profound in every department of science. The pseudo-success of politica!
The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be "voluntarily" reproduced and combined. The psychological obstacles to the restoration of the intemational associations of scientific workers are still too for? The psychological obstacles to the restoration of the international associations of scientific workers are still too formidable to be overcome by the minority whose ideas and feelings are of a more comprehensive kind. The psychological subjective feeling of time enables us to order our impressions, to state that one event precedes another. The public house is a place which gives people the opportunity to exchange views and ideas on public affairs.
The public, having been wamed of e horrible nature of atomic warfare, has done nothing about it, and to a large extent has dismissed the waming from its consciousness. The public-house is a place which gives people a chance to exchange views and ideas on public affairs. The publication of my book in the language of our fathers fills me with particular delight. The publication of this theoretical method is nevertheless justified, in our opinion, because it provides a clear procedure, characterized by a minimum of assumptions, the carrying out of which has no other diAiculties to overcome than those of a mathematical nature. The purely mechanistic view of nature was thus abandoned. The purpose of any physical theory is to explain as wide a range of phenomena as possible.
The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their position in space with "time." The purpose of the following remarks is to justify this belief and to show that a profound change in our views on the composition and essence of light is imperative. The purpose of the following remarks is to show that the answer should be "Yes." The purpose of the following remarks is to show that the answer should be Yes. The qualitative and quanti- tative description of the induction phenomena is very simple in terms of the field language. The quantities t; we call the " energy components " of the gravitational fi.eld. The quantity C is therefore a universal constant; the kinetic theory of gases shows its value to be R/N, where the constants R and N have been defined above.
The quantity s we call the length of the interval. The quantity which is directly measurable by our unit measuring rods and clocks, dX12 + dX 22 + dX32 ?dX 42 or its negative, ds2 = ?dX12 ? The quantum law was next extended by Einstein to the problems of decrease of specific heat at low temperature, and here also his theory was confirmed in a brilliant manner. The quantum theoretical treatment of this case is as fol? The quantum theory again created new and essential features of our reality. The question as to whether an in- ertial system exists at all is still unsettled. The question as to which of the propositions shall be considered as definitions and which as natural laws nected, and how we are to coordinate them to sense experiences.
The question as to which of the theorems shall be considered as de:finitions and which as natural laws will depend largely upon the chosen representation. The question is :first: How can one assign a discrete succes? The question led to the problem of an interpretation of matter in terms of feld theory, the solution of which would fumish an ex? The question may lie open 118 I'lU^CIl'LE OF KELATIVlTV whether the theories of the electro-magnetic lield and the gravitational-liekl together, will form a sufficient basis fur the theory of matter. The question now arises as to which of these two theorems is the better in accord with experience. The question of "truth" of the individual geometrical propositions is thus reduced to one of the "truth" of the axioms.
The question whether the practical geometry of the universe is Euclidean or not has a clear meaning, and its answer can only be furnished by experience. The question whether the structure of this continuum is Euclidean, or in accordance with Riemann's general scheme, or otherwise, is, according to the view which is here being advocated, properly speaking a physical question which must be answered by experience, and not a question of a mere convention to be selected on practical grounds.
The question whether the structure of this continuum is Euclidean, or in accordance with Riemanns general scheme, or otherwise, is, according to the view which is here being advocated, properly speaking a physical question which must be answered by experience, and not a question of a mere convention to be selected on practical grounds. The question with which we are concerned can be put as follows: Is an atomistic theory of matter and electricity conceivable which, while excluding singularities in the field, makes use of no other field variables than those of the gravita- tional field (g)and those of the electromagnetic field in the sense of Maxwell (vector potentials, p)? The questions as to whether Euclidean geometry is true or not does not concern him.
The radiation given off by the sun is energy, for part of it is trans- formed into heat on the earth. The radical novelty in the ether of the general theory of relativity as against the ether of Lorentz lies in this, that the state of the former at every point is determined by the laws of its relationship with matter and with the state of the ether at neighbor- ing points expressed in the form of differential equations, whereas the state of Lorentz^s ether in the absence of electro-magnetic fields is determined by nothing outside it and is the same everywhere. The radio broadcast has a unique function to fill in bringing nations together.
The rate of pulsation of the sphere will certainly have a great effect, making the wave-length shorter if the pulsation becomes more rapid, longer if the pulsation becomes slower. The ratio of the masses of two bodies is defined in mechanics in two ways which differ from each other fundamentally; in the first place, as the reciprocal ratio of, the accelerations which the same motive force imparts to them (inert mass), and in the second place, as the ratio of the forces which act upon them in the same gravitational field (gravitational mass). The ratio of the time unit to the length unit is chosen in a manner so as to make the velocity of light equivalent to unity. The re- cognition of this fact marked a distinct advance in scientific investigation.
The reactionary politicians bave managed to instill suspicion of al!intellectual efforts into the public by dangling before their eyes a danger from without. The reader may think that such a description of the world would be quite inadequate. The reading has already given us much; it has taught us the rudi- ments of the language of nature; it has enabled us to understand many of the clues, and has been a source of joy and excitement in the oftentimes painful ad- vance of science. The real di:fficulty, the dillculty which has baffi.ed the sages of all times, is rather this: how can we make our teaching so potent in the emotional life of man, that its influence should withstand the pressure of the elemental psychic forces in the individuai? The real essence of the conceiv?
The real pacifists, those who are not up in the clouds, but who think and count realities, must give up idle words, and fearlessly try to accomplish something of definite value to their cause. The reality created by modern physics is, indeed, far removed from the reality of the early days. The really great scientists have always known this and felt it passionately, even though in times of politica! The really great scientists have always known this and felt it passionately, even though in times of political confusion they may have remained isolated among their colleagues of inferior calibre. The really valuable thing in the pageant of buman life seems to me not the politica!
The really valuable thing in the pageant of human life seems to me not the State but the creative, sentient individual, the personality; it alone creates the noble and the sublime, while the herd as such remains dull in thought and dull in feeling. The reason for the introduction of the factor - 21< will be upparent later. The reason for this is as follows. The reason for this lack of immediate evidence is the very small rate of exchange between matter and energy. The reason for this lies in the fact that, regardless of important progress reached since the time of Newton, we have not yet arrived at a new foundation of physics concem? The reason is that it has been found necessary to use-for the mathematical representation of the so-called quantum phe?
The reason lies no doubt in those phenomena which gave rise to the theory of forces acting at a distance, and in those properties of light which led to the wave-theory. The reasons he gives are obscure, for they quite obviously are pretexts. The rebuilding of Palestine as the Jewish National Home differs fundamentally from all other Jewish activities of our time. The recent experimental works of 38 PRINCIPLE OF HELATIVITT Nernst and Warburg seem to indicate that through Einstein's genius, we are probably for the first time having a satisfactory theory of photo-chemical action. The recog- nition of the new concepts grew steadily, until substance was overshadowed by the field.
The rectangular components of the observed and of the calculated deviations of the stars (in seconds of arc) are set forth in the following table of results : (c) Displacement of Spectral Lines Towards the Red In Section 23 it has been shown that in a system K1 which is in rotation with regard to a Galileian system K, clocks of identical construction, and which are considered at rest with respect to the rotating reference-body, go at rates which are dependent on the positions of the clocks. The reference system may thereby be chosen as rigid, of Efuclidian type, in three- dimensional metric relations. The reference-system K' has no acceleration. The region bounded by the fore-cone may be called the fore-side of O, and the region bounded by the aft-cone may be called the aft-side of O.
The relation (C) can be written as { C } a./=ewF. The relation ds2 = g.vd X.dx . The relation is not analogous to that of soup to beef but rather of check number to overcoat. The relation is not analogous to that of soup to beef but rather of wardrobe number to over? The relations (22) and (22a) which when equated define the Lorentz transformation show, further, a difference in the role of the time co-ordinate from that of the space co-ordinates; for the term Ate has the opposite sign to the space terms, x12, x22,x32 . The relations in question can be divided into two classes. The relations must be so chosen that the law of the transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the same ray of light (and of course for every ray) with respect to K and K1.
The relations which are derived there for the co-ordlnates themselves are valid also for co-ordinate differences, and thus also for co-ordinate differentials (indefinitely small differences). The relative di:fference of the two is on the order of Yio of one percent. The relative discrepancies to be expected between the stellar photographs obtained during the eclipse and the comparison photographs amounted to a few hundredths of a millimetre only. The relative motion of the different parts of each body is not to occur. The relativity postulate in its general form that makes the space-time coordinates to physically meaningless parameters, is directed with stringent necessity to a very specific theory of gravitation that explains the perihelion motion of mercury.
The relativity principle states that all natural laws that hold in a reference frame K' moving uniformly relative to the ether are identical with those that hold in K, a reference frame at rest relative to the ether. The relativity theory arose from necessity, from serious and deep contradictions in the old theory from which there seemed no escape. The relativity theory begins with these two assumptions. The religions of all civilized peoples, especially the peoples of the Orient, are primarily moral religions. The religions of all the civilized peoples, especially those of the Orient, are principally moral religions.
The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no Church whose central teachings are based on it. The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no church whose centra! The religious geniuses of all times have been distinguished by this cosmic religious sense, which recognizes neither dogmas nor God made in man's image. The remarkable thing in the result is that in the first-approximation of motion of the material pointy only the component ^^^ of the fundamental tensor appears. The remarkableness of this fact struck Newton himself.
The representation given above of spherical geometry on the plane is important for us, because it readily allows itself to be transferred to the three-dimensional case. The resistance becomes infinitely great as the velocity approaches that of light. The resistance to this essential step forward comes from those unfortunate national traditions which are handed on like a hereditary disease from generation to generation through the workings of the educational system. The resonator is thus acted upon by a force in the beam direction of the radiation bundle. The rest-ray 12 = t'w * also belong to the same type (page 39). The restricted theory fused space-time into one indissoluble whole. The resul t then follows by equation (11).
The result does not refer to one, but to many repeated measurements. The result for the absolute value of the entropy is in agreement with well known results from quantum statistics. The result is a want of solid foundations in the individual which amounts in its extremer forms to moral instability. The result is unemployment and excessive competition among the workers, both of which reduce purchasing power and put the whole economic system intolerably out of gear. The result is unemployment and unhealthy competition among the workers, both of which reduce purchasing-power and thereby put the whole economie system intoleraqly out of gear. The result may well be that represented in the above drawing.
The result of Faraday's experiment could be deduced from this with the law of conservation of energy. The result of Rowland's experiment certainly shakes this belief. The result of measurement with a rod relatively at rest as regards K' would be a number which is greater than tt. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capitai the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized politica!society. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society.
The result of these experiments can be expressed simply : The velocity of light in vacua is approximately 186,000 miles per second, or 300,000 kilometres per second. The result of this will be a circular movement of the liquid of the type illustrated in fig. The result of this will be to strech the rope so that it will hang " vertically " downwards. The result was a verdict of "death" to the theory of a calm ether-sea through which all matter moves. The result was merely the concentration of all the difficulties in a few essential points, such as ether in the case of optical phenomena. The result, shown in the next drawing, indicates that the force is vertical, and directed downward.
The resulting relationship takes for granted that the laws of Euclidean geometry hold for "distances;" the "distance" being represented physically by means of the convention of two marks on a rigid body. The results are exactly the same ! The results of observation have been collected together, and discussed in detail from the standpoint of the question which has been engaging our attention here, in a paper by E. Freundlich entitled "Zur PrYfung der allgemeinen Relativit&umlaut;ts-Theorie" (Die Naturwissenschaften, 1919, No.
The results of our measurements are nothing else than well-proved theorems about such coincidences of material points, of our measuring rods with other material points, coincidences between the hands of a clock, dial-marks and point-events occuring at the same position and at the same time. The results of technical progress are most baleful where they furnish means for the destruction of human life and the hard-won fruits of toil, as we of the older generation experienced to our horror in the Great War.
The results of the last three sections show that the apparent incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle of relativity (Section 7) has been derived by means of a consideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses from classical mechanics; these are as follows: (1) The time-interval (time) between two events is independent ofthe condition of motion of the body of reference. The results of the measurements confirmed the theory in a thoroughly satisfactory manner. The results of the previous investigation lead to a very interesting conclusion, which is here to be deduced. The results of the work of Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz led to the de- velopment of modern physics, to the creation of new concepts, forming a new picture of reality.
The results were not presented as ready-made, but scien? The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical behaviour of bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage. The revision has already been successful!}' The rhythm is changed and the time differs because the clock is moving relative to the lower c.s. The right hand side of (27) is linear and homogeneous with reference to A .and its fb-st differential co-efficient so that this law of foi-mation leads to a tensor not only in the case of a tensor of the type A B but also in the case of a summation for all such tensors, ^,e.J in the case of any co-variant tensor of the second rank. The rigid bar represents, in the simple case of rectilinear motion, a c.s.
The rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest, and the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod. The rigorous analysis of such words as "very near", "very short" is far from simple. The rise and fall of the substance theory of heat, already discussed here, is one of many possible examples. The rivers of the southern hemisphere behave in the opposite manner (Beer's law). The rnathematical irnportance of this tensor is as follows : If the continuum is of such a nature that there is a co-ordinate system with reference to which tbe gv are constants, then all the B,,.,. The road to this paradise was not as comfortable and alluring as the road to the religious paradise; but it has proved it- self as trustworthy, and I have never regretted having chosen it.
The role which is played by the Z-axis in the transfor- mation (4) can easily be transferred to any other axis when the system of axes are subjected to a transformation SPECIAL LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION ll about this last axis. The room and its observer move through the ether. The room carries within it the material medium, the air through which sound waves are propagated, and the velocities of sound will, therefore, be different for the inside and outside observer. The room is moving, and the observers inside and outside determine the time-space co-ordinates of the same events. The rotating cylinders look like ships funnels, only they are several times as high and thick. The rotation of the cylinders gives rise to a motion with a greater velocity at B than at A.
The route which, in accordance with Bose, has to be taken in the sequel can be characterized as follows: The phase space of an elementary entity (here: a monoatomic molecule) with respect to a given (three-dimensional) volume is divided into OcellsO of magnitude h3. The rubber rod, like all other bodies under normal conditions, is electrically neutral. The rule for reading the direction of a force from such a model is not as simple as in our previous ex- ample, where the lines of force were straight. The rule may also be demonstrated in this form : If B"' and C" are any vectors, and if, for all values of these, the inner product A,uvB1ac is a scalar, then Av is a covariant tensor. The same Maxwell's equations describe both electric induction and optical refraction.
The same coefficients, b, also determine the inverse substitution of x?. The same data can be obtained in different ways, starting from quite dif- ferent clues. The same experiment is repeated over and over again in exactly the same way; the electrons all have the same velocity and move in the direction of the two pinholes. The same fact is often ex- pressed more scientifically: the earth is our co-ordinate system. The same four vectors may be drawn in another way, in which they all diverge from <* a common point. The same holds good for electronic waves. The same is possible in the case of magnetic phenomena. The same is true for electronic waves.
The same kind of external force is recognized in the motion of a stone falling through the air and in the revolution of the moon in its orbit, namely, that of the earth's attraction for material bodies. The same laws of mechanics apply to all inertial systems moving relative to each other. The same ought to hold good for the iron bar of the magnetic dipole, contrary to the results of the second experiment. The same phenomenon occurs, the leaves separate. The same physical process can be repeated by inverting the glass. The same process can be looked at from a different point of view, that of energy. The same propagation of light may also be considered relatively to K', in which case also the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light must be satisfied.
The same sort of thing happens with a curving stream (fig. The same statement may be made for the pro1ective vanety of the theory, which has been elaborated with great cai:e, in paricula:, by v. Dantzig and by Pauli. The same theory does more, enabling us to understand not only these, but many other facts in the realm of "electrostatics". The same thing happens to him as to the historian, who in the same way, even though perhaps unconsciously, groups actual events around ideals which he has formed for himself on the subject of human society. The same thing must take place, judged from K', if we do not define time with respect to K' in a wholly unnatural way, (that is, in such a way that the laws with respect to K' depend explicitly upon the time).
The same thing will be done in tbe present paper. The same will be true of analytical mechanics, and indeed of any ex- position of the logically deductive sciences. The same work may owe its origin to fear and compulsion, ambi? The same work may owe its origin to fear and compulsion, ambitious desire far authority and distinction, or loving interest in the object and a desire far truth and understanding, and thus to that divine curiosity which every healthy child possesses, but which so often is weakened early. The sanctity of life vanished and the individuai was no longer able to do as he pleased and to go where he liked. The scalar of equation (13) agrees with (14).
The school has always been the most important means of transferring the wealth of tradition from one generation to the next. The school should always have as its aim that the young man leave it as a harmonious personality, not as a special? The school should always have as its aim that the young man leave it as a harmonious personality, not as a specialist. The scient:ifc way of thinking has a further characteristic. The scientific basis for Flettners invention is really some two hundred years old. The scientific life of our time is no longer conceivable without his periodica!. The scientific life of our time is simply inconceivable vzthout his paper.
The scientific method itself would not have led anywhere, it would not even have been born without a passionate striving for clear understanding. The scientific method itself would not have led anywhere, it would not even have been born, without a passionate striving for clear understanding. The scientilc way of forming concepts differs from that which we use in our daily life, not basically, but merely in the more precise definition of concepts and conclusions; more painstaking and systematic choice of experimental materia ; and greater logical economy. The scientist has to worm these general principles out of nature by perceiving certain general features which permit of precise formulation, amidst large complexes of empirical facts.
The scientist must, at least in part, commit his own crime, as well as carry out the investi- gation. The scientist reading the book of nature, if we may be allowed to repeat the trite phrase, must find the solution for himself; for he cannot, as impatient readers of other stories often do, turn to the end of the book. The search for answers leads into quantum theory. The search for laws describing this influence caused a change in the basic ideas about the nature of radiation. The second class of facts to which we have alluded has reference to the question whether or not the motion of the earth in space can be made perceptible in terrestrial experiments. The second concept is that of wave-length.
The second connects the changing magnetic field with the induced current and arose from Faraday's experiment. The second event is the coincidence of the stone with our rigid rod (the tower) at 240 feet above the ground. The second form of existence is after all the essential one; the first, indspensable as it may be, occupies only an inferior position. The second goal, that is, the possibility of the spiritual development of all individuals, is to be secured, a second kind of outward freedom is necessary. The second group of problems had to do with the common conception of an antagonism between different sorts of tissue. The second may be written as d<Jik ^1 , 9t^A de^ 6oJ/, dj-j , do)k dcj, 9.i'i cIt 9<'2 dr Q'i's dr 9 .c^.
The second member is an expression for impulse and energy which the gravitation-field exeits per time and per volume upon matter. The second membw in (26) ie symmetrical in the indiceR /A, and V, Hence A ,A is an antisymmetrical tensor built up in a very simple manner. The second method which I suggest appears less illegal. The second part is that part of lor f, in which the diffentiations operate upon the components of F alone. The second principle on which the special relativity theory rests is that of the constancy of the velocity of light in a vacuum. The second question is thus easily answered, as soon as we are able to decide what are the elements of the physical reality.
The second step consists of the realization of the field as something real; the electro- magnetic field once created exists, acts, and changes according to Maxwell's laws. The second step is to be found in the fact that, in our thinking (which determines our expectation ) , we attribute to this concept of the bodily object a significance, which is to a high degree independent of the sense impression which originally gives rise to it. The second step is to be found in the ing. The second term allows itself to be transformed in accordance with (29a). The second term may be re-modelled by (31), so that we bave ()2 ( ) i)3gafl g"flr. The second term of the expression for 2 can be explained by the oscillation theory.
The second term on the lef t-hand side of (52a) yields in the first place or -()' . The second term on the lef t-hand side of the equation is so chosen that the divergence of the left hand side of (1) vanishes identically, so that taking the divergence of (1), we obtain the equation (2) which in the limiting case of the special theory of relativity gives the complete equations of conservation. The second term on the left results from contraction in the indices ? The second thing that strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to !ife.

The second-named motive, ambition or, in milder terms, the aiming at recognition and consideration, lies firmly fixed in human nature. The secret of the bomb should be committed to a world government, and the United States should immediately ? The secret of this success lies not only in his swift comprehension of people and things and his marvellous command of language, but above all in this, that one feels that his whole heart is in the business in hand, and that, when he is at work, he has room for nothing else in his mind.
The sense of being involved in the destiny of the rest of the world, and in particular of the mother country of Europe, is even less strong than in normal times. The sense-experiences are the given subject-matter. The sentence "the number of nodes in a standing wave is 3\*576" is pure nonsense. The sentence: "The material point has such-and-such posi- tion and velocity at such-and-such an instant," has a definite meaning in classical mechanics. The separated colours of the spectrum could be mixed together again by a second prism properly adjusted, unless the explanation given is wrong. The series of colours in the white light of the sun, as revealed by Newton's experiment, is called the spectrum of the sun, or more precisely, its visible spectrum.
The set of four equations (22) again shows the sym- metry in (^',^,-,0? The set of functions u(x() is determined by the choice of the physical quantity A.

The sign has been so chosen that T4 is positive for the case of the special relativity theory. The significance is that something remains constant throughout the process, and that something is energy. The silently accepted motto is "Leave it alone and don't speak of it." The similarity between the diffraction of an electronic wave and that of an X-ray is particularly marked as seen from a comparison of the patterns in Plate III. The similarity between the kinetic theory of matter and quantum physics lies chiefly in their statistical character. The simple fact that we can see through a vessel whether or not there is air inside shows us that the presence of air matters very little.
The simple mechanical law of adding and subtracting velocities is no longer valid or, more precisely, is only approximately valid for small velocities, but not for those near the velocity of light. The simpler and more fundamental our assumptions become, the more intricate is our mathematical tool of reasoning; the way from theory to observation becomes longer, more subtle, and more complicated. The simpler our picture of the external world and the more facts it embraces, the more strongly it reflects in our minds the harmony of the universe. The simplest case is that of a perfect fluid in which the pressure is determined by a scalar p. Since the tangential stresses P=,, etc., vanish in this case, the contribution to the energy tensor must be of the form p??.
The simplest derivation rested upon the following considera- tion. The simplest equations to which such semivectors can be reduced furnish a key to the understanding of the existence of two sorts of ele- mentary particles, of different ponderable mass and equal but opposite electrical charge. The simplest example of a standing wave is the motion of a cord with the two ends fixed, an up-and- down motion, as shown in our drawing. The simplest guess seems to be that this force depends on the dis- tance in the same way as gravitational force, which diminishes, say, to one-ninth of its former strength if the distance is made three times as great.
The simplest procedure appears to be to choose coordinate systems in the following way: (1) One coordinate system to describe one of the congruent sheets. The simplest solution of this kind is that for an electrical particle without gravita? The simplest thing was, of course, to retain the Laplacian scalar potential of gravity, and to com- plete the equation of Poisson in an obvious way by a term differentiated as to time in such a way that the special theory of relativity was satisfied. The simplest way to imagine this is that a light quantum delivers its entire energy to a single electron: we shall assume that this is what happens. The situation grows more and more serious. The situation may be expressed by an image: Science without religion is lame, religion with?
The situation may be expressed by an image: science without re? The situation of our Jewish communities scattered throughout the world forms at once a barometer of the moral standard in the political world. The situation prevailing in an economy based on the private ownership of capitai is thus characterized by two main principles: first, means of production ( capitai) are pri? The situation prevailing in an economy based on the private ownership of capital is thus characterized by two main principles: first, means of production (capital) are privately owned and the owners dispose of them as they see fit; second, the labor contract is free. The situation, however, is somewhat as follows. The small circle in our drawing represents an attracting body, say, the sun.
The smaller that mean density, the greater is the volume of universal space. The smile on the faces of the people in photo? The smile on the faces of the people in photographs is symbolical of one of the American's greatest assets. The so-called special or restricted relativity theory is based on the fact that Max? The social conscience of the rich man is much more highly developed than in Europe. The social feelings are another source of the crystallization of religion. The social impulses are another source of the crystallization of religion. The sole criterion of the value of any scientific theory must ultimately be its capacity for offering a simple. The sole exception is Mercury, the planet which lies nearest the sun.
The solubility of this pro- blem is the condition of the complete comprehensibility of nature. The solution itself, contrary to those of inferior mysteries, does not disappoint us; more- over, it appears at the very moment we expect it. The solution of the above-mentioned dilemma was therefore as follows: A physical significance at- taches not to the differentials of the co-ordinates but only to the Riemannian metric co-ordinated with them. The solution of the equations (10), (11), (12) leads to (U\ r -!Ljl1!i_ r- =/- t= TL^L^ V \.q- Vl q^ Now we shall make a very important observation about the vectors u and u.
The solution of the problem of the motion of neutra} particles evidently amounts to the discovery of such solutions of the gravitational equations (written free of denominators), as contain several bridges. The solution of this problem, when freely considered, is simple enough, and it seems also to echo from the teachings of the wise men of the past always in the same strain: All men should Iet their conduct be guided by the same prin? The solution then corresponds to an infinite extension of the central space, filled uniformly with matter. The sons together bave somewhat less than the father had (the mass sum M' + M" is somewhat smaller than the mass M of the radioactive atom). The sound waves produced will then never be able to reach our ears.
The source of all scientific advancement is the God-given curiosity of the toiling experimenter and the constructive fantasy of the technical inventor. The space of reference of K is therefore distinguished, with respect to its physical properties, from all spaces of reference which are in motion relatively to it (quiescent ether). The space structure on which it is based may be described as follows, and the description applies equally to a space of any number of dimensions. The space-time theory and the kinematics of the special theory of relativity were modelled on the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of the electromagnetic field.
The space-time vector of the iirst kind (89) K=lor S, is of very great importance for which we now want to demonstrate a very important transformation According to 78), S=L-|-/F, and it follows that lor S=lor L + lor/F. The special aim which I have constantly kept before me is logical unification in the field of physics. The special ca.se of the restricted theory of rela.tivity ; a.nd in a.ddition Jl = fe, J2 = jy, J3 = jz, J4 = p, we obtain in place of (63) U>E' + J. The special principle of relativity forbids us to regard the ether as composed of particles the movements of which can be followed out through time, but the theory is not incompatible with the ether hypothesis as such.
The special properties of space and time in any region are defined by these r/s which are themselves determined, by the actual distribution of matter in the locality. The special relativity theory achieved therr logical reconciliation by making a change in kinematics, that is to say, in the doctrine of the physical laws of space and time. The special relativity theory furnished the other clue. The special relativity theory has led to the conception that the inertial mass (Trage Masse) is no other than energ}'. The special relativity theory rests on the following poetulate which also holds valid for the Gialileo-Newtonian mechanics.
The special relativity theory which was simply a systematic extension of the electro-dynamics of Maxwell and Lorentz, had consequences which reached beyond itself. The special theory of relativity finally succeeded in reconciling them logically by a modification of kinematics i.e., of the doctrine of the laws relating to space and time (from the point of view of physics). The special theory of relativity forbids us to assume the ether to consist of particles observable through time, but the hypothesis of ether in itself is not in conflict with the special theory of relativity. The special theory of relativity has crystallised out from the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomena. The special theory of relativity has led to a dear under?
The special theory of relativity has led to the conclusion that inert mass is nothing more or less than energy, which finds its complete mathematical expression in a symmetrical tensor of second rank, the energy-tensor. The special theory of relativity has rendered the Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less unequivocally in its favour. The special theory of relativity is therefore the appli? The special theory of relativity owes itS" origin to Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic field. The special theory of relativity removes this lack of preci? The special theory of relativity retained the basis of classica!
The special theory of relativity, on the other hand, creates a formal dependence between the way in which the spatial coordinates, on the one hand, and the temporal coordinates, on the other, have to enter into the natural laws. The special theory of relativity, which was simply a systematic development of the electro-dynamics of Clerk Maxwell and Lorentz, pointed beyond itself, however. The special theory, on which the general theory rests, applies to all physical phenomena with the exception of gravitation; the general theory provides the law of gravitation and its relations to the other forces of nature. The spectroscope is an instrument which acts like a prism, but with much greater accuracy and sensitiveness; it splits light into its components, that is, it analyses it.
The speed of light c is one of the quantities which occurs as "universal constant" in physical equations. The speed of the plate decreases continuously between two such collisions, due to the radiation friction, which transforms the kinetic energy of the plate into radiative energy. The sphere which has been moving uniformly tries to get as far away from the centre and as near to the walls of the room as possible. The spirit of international solidarity should also be strength? The splitting of the two-dimensional continuum into two one-dimensional ones seems, from the point of view of the relativity theory, to be an arbitrary procedure without objective meaning.
The standing wave produced by a violin player is, in fact, still more complicated, being a mixture of very many waves with two, three, four, five, and more nodes and, therefore, a mixture of several wave-lengths. The stars in the neighbourhood of the sun are photographed during a solar eclipse. The starting-point is again Galileo's law of inertia. The statP, of motion of a system of coordinates cannot be chosen arbitrarily if the laws of mechanics are to hold good ( it must be free from twisting and from acceleration ) . The state has thus become a modem idol whose suggestive power few men are able to escape.
The state of affairs here is the same as in the ordinary vector calculus, where by the vector- multiplication of a vector of the first, and a vector of the second type (t.e., a polar vectoi), we obtain a vector of the first type (axial vector). The state of mind which enables a man to do work of this kind is akin to that of the religious worshiper or the lover; the daily effort comes from no deliberate intention or program, but straight from the heart. The state of motion of an inertia-system so far as mechanics are concerned, is not restricted by nature to one condition. The state of motion of an inertial system is according to mechanics not one that is determined uniquely by nature.
The state of motion of the co-ordinate system may not, however, be arbitrarily chosen, if the laws of mechanics are to be valid (it must be free from rota- tion and acceleration). The statement made above follows from this, after interchanging the indices of summation, ? The statement made above follows from this, since, by (64), we must also have dx'? The statements I have issued to the Press were concerned with my intention to resign my position in the Academy and renounce my Prussian citizenship; I gave as my reason for these steps that I did not wish to live in a country where the individual does not enjoy equality before the law and freedom to say and teach what he likes.
The statements that follow are largely my personal opinion, or the results of considerations that have not yet been checked enough by others. The states of this medium, imagined as constituting the electro-magnetic fields, were at first thought of mechanically, on the model of the elastic deformations of rigid bodies. The statistical law which we assumed, corresponds to that of a radioactive reaction, and the above elementary process corresponds to a reaction in which only y-rays are emitted. The stellar universe ought to be a finite island in the infinite ocean of space. The story of the convulsion of a frog's leg is told in many different ways. The straight line is a special and trivial example of a curve.
The strange part played by space ( or the inertial system ) within the mechanical founda? The strength of the new theory lies in the consistency and simplicity with which it solves all these difficulties, using only a few very convincing assumptions. The stripes become darker at the place where fewer electrons are falling. The stripes correspond to certain definite wave-lengths or, in other words, to photons with a definite energy. The strongest empirica!arguments for the wave nature of light, fixed speeds of propagation, interf erence, di:ffraction, polarization, were either unknown or else not known in any well-ordered syn?
The strongest ground for the choice of the above equation however lies in this, that they lead, as their consequences, to equations expressing the conservation of the components of total energy (the impulses and the energy) which exactly correspond to the equations (49) and (4 9a). The structure of the system is the work of reason ; the empirical contents and their mutual relations must find their representation in the conclusions of the theory. The struggle for this new orientation of political thought and feeling is a severe one, because it has the tradition of centuries against it. The struggle of our own days is being waged primarily for the freedom of politica!
The struggle, so violent in the early days of science, between the views of Ptolemy and Copernicus would then be quite meaningless. The study of the social patterns in certain so-called primitive cultures, however, seems to have made it sufficiently evident that such a defeatist view is wholly unwarranted. The subjective time leads then through the concept of the bodily object and of space, to the concept of objective time, as we shall see later on. The subsequent development is sharply marked by politi? The substance theory of light is now more complicated than before. The substance theory of light seems to work splendidly in all these cases, although the necessity for introducing as many substances as colours may make us somewhat uneasy.
The success of the Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance resulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involving an intermediary medium) of the type of Newton's law of gravitation. The success of this enterprise was quite natural. The successes of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory have given great confidence in the validity of e eletromagnetic equations for empty space and hence, m particular, to the statement that light travels "in space" with a certain constant speed c. Is this law of the in.variability o light. The successes reaped of the logical foundations, which is still up to now by science do, it is true, give a compatible with the observations made certain encouragement for this faith.
The successes reaped up to now by science do, it is true, give a certain encouragement for this faith. The successful systems of physics which have been evolved since rather represent compromises between these two schemes, which for that very reason bear a provisional, logically incomplete character, although they may have achieved great advances in certain particulars. The sum of all possible forms of energy in such a system is constant, although the amount of any one kind may be changing. The sum of four such terms f/li)(l) )</>(4) 8,.. = y(l>.-.,- + . The sum of the two quantities remains unchanged, and is called a constant of the motion. The sun emits radiation which can be split into its components by a prism. The super-national character of scienti.f.c concepts and sci?
The super-national character of scientific concepts and scientific language is due to the fact that they have been set up by the best brains of all countries and all times. The supreme task of the physicist is to arrive at those universal elementary laws from which the cosmos can be built up by pure deduction. The surface is not a Euclidean continuum with respect to the rods, and we cannot define Cartesian co-ordinates in the surface. The surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me. The surplus necessary to support the intellectual worker has suddenly ceased to exist. The switchback The rate of exchange The philosophical back- ground The kinetic theory of matter THE GREAT MYSTERY STORY IN IMAGINATION there exists the perfect mystery story.
The system of collective security collapsed like a house of cards-a collapse the consequences of which cannot be measured even today. The system of equations (13) is by no means satisfied wben we insert for the g, the values given in (7), (8), and (12), and for the (contravariant) energy-tensor of matter the values indicated in (6). The system of reference K' is unaccelerated, but the space-bn8 territory in quesbon is under the sway of a gravitatimml fidd, which generates the accelerated motion of the badie..; relu,tively to K'. The systems of coordinates employed in mechanics is called an inertia-system. The tangent is its prolongation. The tangent to a straight line is the line itself.
The task of determining the motion of matter is com- prised in the following problem:It is required to establish for every space-time jioiut the direction of the space-time line passing through it. The tbeory failed moreover to give any explanation concerning the tremendous forces which hold tbe electric charges on the individuai particles. The tea leaves are swept into the center by the circular movement and act as proof of its existence. The teacher cannot use his inner satisfaction to fili the stomachs of his children. The televised picture is transmitted through electromagnetic waves and thus travels with the speed of light.
The temperature is practically constant for a small part of the slab, and thus the geometrical behaviour of the rods is almost as it ought to be according to the rules of Euclidean geometry. The tension of the rope is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. The tensor A or A is symmetrical, when > . The tensor A or A is thus an tisymmetrical when we have (15) A''*' = -A'''^ or (15a) A =~.A Of the 16 components A'^ , the four components A'^^ vanish, the rest are equal and opposite in pairs ; so that there are only 6 numerically different components present (Six-vector). The tensor A"v, or the tensor Av, is therefore antisymmetrical, if always or respectively, A"'" = - A"', Av = - Av (15a).
The tensor A''v, or the tensor Av, is thus symmetrical if for any combination of the indices ,, v, or respectively, A"v = Av", (14) (14a). The tensor character indicates that the equation of transformation is A xx?' The tensor character of B^ ^ /X(TT shows us, however, that these components vanish collectively also in any other chosen system of reference. The tensor of the second rank has, in general, 16 = 4.4 components. The terror of their tyranny, however, is alleviated by their Jack of consistency. The theorem of the addition of speeds states that the same light beam will not propagate at speed c in a different frame K' moving uniformly relative to the ether. The theorems of congruence, fundamental in geometry, have to do with the laws that govern such changes in position.
The theoretical discovery of an electromagnetic wave spreading with the speed of light is one of the greatest achievements in the history of science. The theoretical physicists of our generation are expecting the erection of a new theoretical basis for physics which would make use of fundamental concepts greatly different from those of the field theory considered up to now. The theoretical scientist is compelled in an increasing degree to be guided by purely mathe- matical, formal considerations in his search for a theory, because the physical experience of the experi- menter cannot lift him into the regions of highest abstraction. The theorist has to set about this Herculean task in the clear conscious- ness that his efforts may only be destined to deal the death blow to his theory.
The theorist who under- takes such a labor should not be carped at as fanci- ful* ; on the contrary, he should be encouraged to give free reign to his fancy, for there is no other way to the goal. The theorist's method involves his using as his foundation general postulates or principles from which he can deduce conclusions. The theory also explains very simply the reflection of light by mirrors as the same kind of reflection as that shown in the mechanical experiment of elastic balls thrown against a wall, as the next drawing indicates. The theory avoids all internal dis? The theory enables us to answer this question from certain measurements of the Brownian motion of a suspended particle.
The theory finds the justification for its existence in the fact that it correlates a large number of single observations, and it is just here that the " truth " of the theory lies. The theory here suggests itself in its simplest and most primitive form. The theory makes the first serious effort, since Newton's time, to reformulate the law of gravitation. The theory of Clerk Maxwell and Lorentz led in- evitably to the special theory of relativity, which ruled out the existence of forces acting at a distance, and resulted in the destruction of the notion of absolute simultaneity. The theory of Relativity received direct experimental confiimation in several directions.
The theory of four-dimensional tensors of special relativity differs from the theory of tensors in three-dimensional space, therefore, only in the number of dimensions and the relations of reality. The theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general postulate of relativity excels not only in its beauty ; nor in removing the defect attaching to classical mechanics which was brought to light in Section 21; nor in interpreting the empirical law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass ; but it has also already explained a result of observation in astronomy, against which classical mechanics is powerless. The theory of relativity arose out of efforts to improve, with reference to logica!economy, the foundation of physics as it existed at the turn of the century.
The theory of relativity belongs to the latter class. The theory of relativity deduces, from its fundamental assumption, a clear and convincing answer to this question, an answer again of a quantitative character: all energy resists change of motion; all energy behaves like matter; a piece of iron weighs more when red-hot than when cool; radiation travelling through space and emitted from the sun contains energy and therefore has mass; the sun and all radiating stars lose mass by emitting radiation. The theory of relativity further gives the following formulae, valid to the desired approximation, v' = vll cos <pJ, V cos q>'= cos q> V 1 c c (15) cos 2 ? The theory of relativity is a fine example of the fundamental character of the modern development of theoretical science.
The theory of relativity is a theory of principle. The theory of relativity is often criticized for giving, without justification, a central theoretical role to the propagation of light, in that it founds the concept of time upon the law of propagation of light. The theory of relativity is that physical theory which is based on a consistent physical interpretation of these three concepts. The theory of relativity leads to the same law of motion, without requiring any special hypothesis whatsoever as to the structure and the behaviour of the electron. The theory of relativity may indeed be said to have put a sort of finishing touch to the mighty intellectual edifice of Maxwell and Lorentz, inasmuch as it seeks to extend field physics to all phenomena, gravitation included.
The theory of the Rontgen spectra, of the visible spectra, and the periodic system of the ele- ments is primarily based on the ideas of Bohr. The theory of thermal radiation has given important clues about this, mostly by the theory on which Planck based his radiation formula. The theory to be developed is basedNlike all electrodynamicsNon the kinematics of the rigid body, since the assertions of any such theory have to do with the relationships between rigid bodies (systems of co-ordinates), clocks, and electromagnetic processes.
The theory which is sketched in the following pages forms the most wide-going generalization conceivable of what is at present known as " the theory of Relativity ; " this latter theory I differentiate from the former "Special Relativity theory," and suppose it to be known. The theory with which we are dealing is certainly naive and inadequate from the point of view of modern physics. The theory works splendidly because all these phenomena involve large aggregations and not single individuals.
The theory, with the support of some data from simple experiments having nothing to do with the actual propagation of waves, gives a clear answer: the^ velocity of an electromagnetic wave is equal to the velocity qf lijjrz ~ Oersted's and Faraday's experiments formed the basis on which Maxwell's laws were built.

The thing that has brought discredit upon the prevailing form of democracy in Europe to-day is not to be laid to the door of the democratic idea as such, but to lack of stability on the part of the heads of governments and to the impersonal character of the electoral system.

The things hereaf ter called tensors are further characterized by the fact that the equations of transformation for their components are linear and homogeneous. The things herefrom designated as " Tensors " have further the property that the transforma- tion equation of their components are linear and homogene- ous ; so that all the components in the new s^^stem vanish if they are all zero in the original system.

The three- dimensional geometry will be a chapter of four-dimensional physics.
The time co-ordinate and the space co-ordinate will be different in two c.s., and the change in the time co-ordinate will be quite distinct if the relative velocity is close to that of light. The time for the double journev alon^' OA and back is t,= + -A = J^= ^/S^ G If. The time for the two journeys was again the same, so that OB must now be the shorter length. The time has come for the UN to strengthen its moral au? The time of an event is that which is given simultaneously with the event by a stationary clock located at the place of the event, this clock being synchronous, and indeed synchronous for all time determinations, with a specified stationary clock.
The time of an event taking place at a point P( x, y, z) is then defined as the time shown on the clock e simultaneously with the event. The time so specified is at all events independent of the position of the system of co-ordinates in our space of reference, and is therefore an invariant with respect to the transformation (3). The time t of the event in P is the reading of the clock e at the time of arriva! The time-axis can be parallel to any vector of the first kind. The time-like ds can be measured directly by a suitably chosen clock. The time-like extremal lines of this metric furnish the law of motion of a material point which is acted on by no force apart from the forces of gravity. The time-which, looking back, seems so idyllic-is gane for?
The timeNwhich, looking back, seems so idyllicNis gone forever when individuals or relatively small groups could be completely self-sufficient. The tmblic also may not appreciate that, in relation to the damage infilcted, atomic bombs already have become the most economical form of destruction that can be used on the offensive. The total energy, kinetic plus potential, can be compared, for example, with money kept intact as to amount but changed continually from, one currency to another, say from dollars to pounds and back again, according to a well- defined rate of exchange. The total mass M of the universe, according to our view, is finite, and is in fact M = P . The total momentum of the system before absorption is therefore Mv + e .v Aer the absorption let M' be the mass of B.
The total momentum transfer to the molecule produced by the absorption of radiation is therefore, per unit time, hv' ~pnBZ J e'(v't<p')cos<p' This follows from (6) and (9), and the integration extends over all elementary solid angles. The total momentum transfer to the molecule produced by the absorption of radiation is therefore, per unit time, hv' ~pnBZ[exp(-enlkT) C dx' - p ( - < W * T ) ] J e'(v't<p')cos<p' This follows from (6) and (9), and the integration extends over all elementary solid angles. The totality of all Lorentz-Transformations forms a group. The totality of these connections - aim by the use of a minimum of primary none of which is expressible in concep concepts and relations.
The totality of these connections,-none of which is expressible in notional terms-is the only thing which differentiates the great building which is science from a logica!but empty scheme of concepts. The tower and scale must, ob- viously, not be made of rubber or any other material which would undergo any change during the experi- ment. The tradition, in the main, still stands; the prosperity is gone. The tragedy of such a fate lies not merely in the unfair treatment to which these minorities are automatically subjected in social and economic matters, but also in the fact that under the suggestive influence of the majority most of the victims themselves succumb to the same prejudice and regard their brethren as inferior beings.
The tragedy of the Jews is that they are people of a definite historical type, who lack the support of a community to keep them together. The transformation of the x, y, z, t of events which has to be car? The transformation process is to be interpreted in the following manner. The transformation to the system K' has been carried out in a number of places in the literature, particularly accurately in Mosengeil's Berlin dissertation. The transformation took place in approximately the following fashion. The transition from Aristotle's line of thought to that of Galileo formed a most important corner-stone in the foundation of science. The transition from one to the other is given by the Lorentz transformation.
The transition from the classical field concept to the corresponding problem of probability waves in quantum physics is a very difficult step. The tremendous development of electricity as a branch of science and technique began with the dis- covery of the electric current. The trite objects of human efforts-possessions, outward suc?

The tube plays the part of the railway embankment or of the co-ordinate system K, the liquid plays the part of the carriage or of the co-ordinate system K1, and finally, the light plays the part of the man walking along the carriage, or of the moving point in the present section. The two are at different potentials. The two are very different, but it is apparent that in our example of the pulsating sphere both motions take place in the same straight line. The two differences of the form H ? The two electric fluids The magnetic fluids The first serious difficulty The velocity of light Light as a substance The riddle of colour What is a wave? The two ends of the same tube are fastened. The two fluids in the conductor, being free to move, are separated, one attracted and the other repelled.
The two have made an agreement that B will open his the moment he sees A's light. The two major differences between Newton's law and Coulomb's law are : gravita- tional attraction is always present, while electric forces exist only if the bodies possess electric charges. The two numbers are the distances from two perpendicular edges of the table.

The two sentences, "the Sun is at rest and the Earth moves," or "the Sun moves and the Earth is at rest," would simply mean two different conventions concerning two different c.s. The two systems do not directly contradict each other; but they seem little adapted to fusion into one unili.ed theory. The two words "standing" and "wave" seem to con- tradict each other; their combination is, nevertheless, justified by the result of the superposition of the two waves. The two-dimensional continuum cannot be split into two one-dimensional continua as in classical physics. The type of critical reasoning which was required for the discovery of this central point was decisively furthered, in my case especially, by the reading of David Hume's and Ernst Mach's philo- sophical writings.
The uncertainty of the empirical result amounts to a few seconds only. The unit measuring rod appears^ when referred to the eo-ordinate-system, shortened by the calculated magnitude through the presence of the gravitational field, when we place it radially in the field. The unit measuring-rod thus appears a little shortened in relation to the system of co-ordinates by the presence of the gravitational field, if the rod is laid along a radius. The unit of time shall be chosen in such a manner with reference to the unit of length that the velocity of light in space becomes unity. The unitary field-theory, which represents itself as a mathematically independent extension of the general theory of relativity, attempts to fulfil this last postulate of the field theory.
The universal moral idea thus owed its originai psychologi? The universal principle of the spe- cial theory of relativity is contained in the postulate: the laws of physics are invariant with respect to the Lorentz-transformations (for the transition from one inertial system to any other arbitrarily chosen sys- tem of inertia). The universe is, so to speak, immersed in ether. The unlimited des'ire for ever greater power seeks to become active and aggressive wherever and a whenever the physical possibility o:ffers itself. The use of a thermometer is based on some obvious physical assumptions. The use of fire, the cultivation of edible plants, the steam engine each was discovered by one man. The use of small quantities, su:fficient, say, to operate a car or an air?
The usual answer to this question is "No," but that is not the right answer. The usual answer to this question is No, but that is not the right answer. The usual answer to this question is: "Because it is attracted by the earth." The usual conclusion from this in quantum mechanics is that when the momentnm of a particle is known, its coordhnate has no physical reali ty. The validity of the Lorentz transformation follows from this condition. The validity of the principle of relativity was assumed only for these reference-bodies, but not for others (e.g. The validity of the principle of special relativity also with respect to electromagnetic phenomena can therefore hardly be doubted.
The value obtained for this rotary movement of the orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century, an amount ensured to be correct to within a few seconds of arc. The value of a man, however, should be seen in what he gives and not in what he is able to receive. The value of the inte.orral jdT=f V idx^^+dr^'^+dr^^-^dx^^) 56 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY when calculated upon the space-time line from a fixed initial point P^ to the variable point P, (both being on the space-time line), is known as the ' Proper-time ' of the position of matter we are concerned with at the space-time point P. (It is a generalization of the idea of Positional- time which was introduced by Loi'entz for uniform motion.) The value of this achievement for the Jews everywhere is very great.
The value of this work for all the Jews of the world is very high. The vanishing of the Riemann Tensor is thus a necessary con- dition that for some choice of the axis-system </ 's can be taken as constants. The vapours of the various elements possess 282 THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS different systems oflines, and thus different combinations of numbers designating the wave-lengths composing the emitted light spectrum. The variation of mass predicted by the theory of relativity is immeasurably small and cannot be detected by direct weighing on even the most sensitive scales. The vector ^ is perpendicular to co ; we can call it the Mayuetlo rest-force. The vector character of the force, X , is then a consequence of our general theorem about the derivative of a tensor of x?
The vector character of the second term on the right is obvious. The vector fi fulfils the relation (wl})=W^O^ +(020^ +0)3^23 +0J^O4 =0, (which we can write as 0^=/ (^.O^ +oj,^02 +^^2^3) and O is also normal to w. In case w==o, we have ^^=0, ^4=0, 04^=0, and . The vector fi fulfils the relation (wl})=W^O^ +(020^ +0)3^23 +0J^O4 =0, (which we can write as 0^=/ (^.O^ +oj,^02 +^^2^3) and O is also normal to w. In case w==o, we have ^^=0, ^4=0, 04^=0, and [n 03,0.3 = (J) <I> <b ^1 ^2*^3 I shall call 0, which is a spaoe-time vector 1 st kind the Rest-Ray. The vector from the end-point of the first to that of the second indicates the direction of the acting force. The vector in the next drawing indicates the guessed direction of the uniform motion if all external forces were to vanish.
The vector of the second kind with the components (41) are denoted by \_iOj 5]. The vector of the third type represented by (P/*) is o-iven bv the ijeometrical sum of the tw^o four-vectors of the fir^t type PD and P^D^. The velocities observed in two c.s. The velocity decreases until the stone reaches its highest point and begins to fall. The velocity of light forms the upper limit of velocities for all material bodies. The velocity of light in ether at rest should differ from that in ether which is being quickly dragged round by the motion of the wheel, just as the velocity of a sound wave varies on calm and windy days. The velocity of light is always found to be quite independent of the velocity HISTOBICAL INTRODUCTION XUl of the platform.
The velocity of light is always the same in all c.s. The velocity of light is the upper limit for all velocities. The velocity of light relative to the liquid and the velocity of the latter relative to the tube are thus known, and we require the velocity of light relative to the tube. The velocity of matter does not enter in these equations. The velocity of propagation ot a ray of light relative to the carriage thus comes cut smaller than c. But this result comes into conflict with the principle of relativity set forth in Section V. For, like every other general law of nature, the law of the transmission of light in vacuo must, according to the principle of relativity, be the same for the railway carriage as reference-body as when the rails are the body of reference.
The velocity vector lies in the line of the motion, just as in the case of the moving cart or the rolling spheres. The velocity vector lies on the tangent. The velocity vectors for two very near points are drawn, and the change of velocity found. The velocity w of the man relative to the embankment is here replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. The verdict of the nineteenth century was not final and ultimate. The version published in German newspapers was for the most part incorrect, important sentences being omitted. The vertical speed of a free body in the gravitational field increases uniformly with the time.
The very complexity and the very arbitrariness of these assumptions prevented Planck's ether from attaining any degree of practical importance in the further development of the subject. The very fact that the totality of our sense experiences is such that by means of thinking ( operations with concepts, and the creation and use of definite functional relations be? The very name geometry indicates that the concept of space is 1 It is in the nature of things that we are able to talk about these objects only by means of concepts of our own creation, concepts which themselves are not subject to defnition. The very possibility of distinguishing between geometrical and gravitational forces is denied.
The very presence of matter implies a modification of the characteristics of space and time in its neighbour- hood. The very survival of mankind depends on a satisfactory solution of these problems. The very word geometry, which, of course, means earth-measuring, proves this. The very word geometry, which, of course, means earthmeasuring, proves this. The vessel contains a certain amount of gas to be kept at a constant temperature. The vestiges of national armies can then be either disbanded or placed under the high command of the supranational authority. The view I have just outlined of the purely fictitious character of the fundamentals of scientific theory was by no means the prevailing one in the eighteenth or even the nineteenth century.
The visible fixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to a high degree of approximation. The volume density of this particular radiation is given by d' (13') e'(v',v')dv'-. The volume element odx dx dx dx1 2 3 4 is not an invariant. The wall moving toward the light wave would be reached before the one retreating from the light wave. The war was, hoever, widely regarded as an external event, hardly or not at all as the result of man's conscious planf ul action. The wave begins its journey as in the previous example, but it is soon reflected by the other end of the tube. The wave front is a plane on which at any given moment all parts of the ether behave in precisely the same way.
The wave is propagated in the direction of the radius of the sphere, while the parts of the medium move perpendicularly to this direction. The wave produced is, therefore, transverse. The wave stands, so to speak, between the two nodes, all points of the cord reaching simultaneously the maxima and minima of their deviation. The wave theory may lead to new facts in the future, but I do not know of any experimental data confirming it convincingly. The wave theory of light Longitudinal or transverse light waves? The wave theory of light, which operates with continuous spatial functions, has worked well in the representation of purely optical phenomena 1 and will probably never be replaced by another theory.
The wave under consideration is therefore no less a spherical wave with velocity of propagation c when viewed in the moving system. The wave- length in each case will depend on the number of nodes. The wave-length of homogeneous yellow light differs from that of red or violet. The wave-length of red light is 0-00008 cm. The wave-length of violet light is 0-00004 cm. The waves lead an independent existence and the history of their changes can be followed just as that of any other material object. The way in which he regards its past and present may depend too much on what he hopes for the future and aims at in the present; but that is the inevitable fate of anybody who has occupied himself intensively with a world of ideas.
The way in which the electric intensity enters these equations appears to be wholly independent of the way e in which the magnetic intensity enters them; it would not be surprising if instead of , we l 2e had, say, l2 , or if this term were absent. The way to a joyful and happy state is through renunciation and self-limitation everywhere. The weak point of his conception is, however, this, that those convictions which are necessary and determinant far our conduct and judgments cannot be found solely along this solid scientific way. The weak point of his conception is, however, this, that those convictions which are necessary and determinant for our conduct and judg?
The weakness of the principle of inertia lies in this, that it involves an argument in a circle: a mass moves without acceleration if it is sufficiently far from other bodies; we know that it is sufficiently far from other bodies only by the fact that it moves without acceleration. The weakness of the theory lies on the one hand in the fact that it does not get us any closer to making the connection with wave theory; on the other, that it leaves the duration and direction of the elementary processes to 'chance'. The weaknesses of your plan lie, so it seems to me, in the sphere of psychology, or rather, in your neglect of it. The wealth of colour in the world reflects the variety of colour of which white light is composed.
The wealth of consequences and generalizations from this step will be seen later. The wealth of substances begins to be overwhelming ! The weight of outward oppression on the Jewish people is particularly heavy at the moment. The whole difficulty indicates that the analogy between heat and electricity is by no means complete. The whole evolution of our ideas about the processes of nature, with which we have been concerned so far, might be regarded as an organic development of New- tons ideas. The whole mechanical point of view was based on the belief that all phenomena can be explained in terms of forces depending only on the distance and not on the velocity. The whole of geometry may be founded upon this conception of distance.
The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of every day thinking. The whole process may be analytically repre- sented by means of a parameter A, and to the value A= o, shall correspond the actual curves inside the sicheL Such a ])rocess may be called a virtual displacement in the sichel. The whole puzzle of colour was first scien- tifically attacked and the solution pointed out in the great work of Newton. The whole theory must be based solely on partia differential equations and their singularity-free solutions. The whole theory of invariants of the special theory of relativity depends upon the invariant s2 (23).
The whole world appears to be 72 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY resolved in such 70orld4ineSy and I may just deviate from my point if I say that according to my opinion the physical laws would find their fullest expression as mutual relations among these lines. The wider the range of wave numbers of the oscillators, the greater will be the radiation energy of the space, and in the limit we obtain . The wind, passing over a field of grain, sets up a wave which spreads our across the whole field. The winding of such a clock consists of elevating two weights, thereby adding potential energy to the system.
The word " special " is meant to intimate that the principle is restricted to the case when K' has a motion of uniform translation relatively to K, but that the equivalence of K' and K does not extend to the case of non? The word "electron" is used here for the sake of definiteness; our argument is also valid for photons. The words "static field" mean a field that does not change with time. The work presumes a standard of education corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and, despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the reader. The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job.
The world of events can be described dynamically by a picture changing in time and thrown on to the background of the three-dimensional space. The writers investigate the possibility of an atomistic theory of matter and electricity which, while excluding singularities of the field, makes use of no other variables than the g of the general relativity theory and the pof the Maxwell theory. The young scientist who carries on an ordinary practical profession which maintains him is in a much better position-assuming of course that this profession leaves him with sufficient spare time and energy.
The z-component of this momentum is K sin a or with sufficient accuracy ( except for quantities of 2c higher arder of magnitude ) K a or E. S and S' together therefore have a momentum E in the z direction. TheEfollowing, however, appears to me to be correct in Kant's statement of the problem: in thinking we use, with a certain "right," concepts to which there is no access from the materials of sensory experience, if the situation is viewed from the logical point of view. Theinvariant .j - gdT is equal to the magnitude of the four-dimensional element of volume in the " loca! " Their addition gives the tensor of the third rank A =:^Z^-\''''] A -{"Ia ... (27) /xi'cr ^\ It) " (t) '^^ where A ^ is put=:A B .
Their aim is to break down the wall of contradictions which frequently blocks the way of scientific progress. Their apparatus is far more complicated than that used by Hertz and detects the presence of waves thousands of miles from their sources instead of only a few yards. Their charge and mass were investigated. Their deliberations shall be secret and they are strictly forbidden to give any information about them, even in private. Their difficulties were overcome only when it was successf ully es? Their increase in size as they depart from S is not to be detected by measuring with measuring-rods, any more than in the case of the disc-shadows on E, because the standards of measurement behave in the same way as the spheres. Their physical well-being must be preserved.
Their reactions are different, but their results are supplementary. Their root lies in the validity of the laws of nature for a special class of c.s. Their sense of equality and human dignity is mainly limited to men of white skins. Their simple form conceals a depth revealed only by careful study. Their startingpoint and foundation are not hypothetical constituents, but empirically observed gen? Their system of concepts has served as a guide in the bewildering chaos of perceptions so that we learned to grasp general truths from particular observations. Their totally heterogeneous character may scare us away from the attempt to compound them. Their whole universe of observation extends exclusively over the surface of the sphere. Then '!O = 1, and in piace of (20c) we obtain d 2 x.
Then (20) can be replaced by 8w d\-0 (20a) v^ dr dx ty*=qf L But uA c^A V dA ^ rfA ^ j So we get by the substitution of hw in (^Oa), remem- bering that ^ d\ ^ (Be ) after partial integration, (20b) 1 d\ k Bx =0 <r or L ^ ( 3 ^^ where k =- < . Then +, con- sidered as a function of x~, can be expressed as +(x(, xm) = Q ))(.(xm)u. Then ?0 , the density at rest, is an invariant. Then Ave can easily show that this combination also leads to a tensor, when the vector A is not representable as a gradient. Then B^ may be called the light-point of B.
Then I is the number of elementary events which occur in time T. This is twice the number of absorption processes Zn-+Zm taking place in time T. We therefore have I = PnB% e x p ( - enlkT)QT (24) and from (23), (24) and (22), = -^{) PnK e x p ( - sn/kT)Q. Then I realized that only a common enterprise dear to the hearts of Jews all over the world could restore this people to health. Then Kant took the stage with an idea which, though certainly untenable in the form in which he put it, signified a step towards the solu? Then Kant took the stage with an idea which, though certainly untenable in the form in which he put it, signified a step towards the solution of Hume's dilemma: Whatever in knowledge is of empirical origin is never certain (Hume).
Then Maxwell's equations may be combined into the forms ? Then Planck showed that in order to establish a law of heat radiation con- sonant with experience, it was necessary to employ a method of calculation the incompatibility of which with the principles of classical physics became clearer and clearer. Then Sim vanishes due to (1b), so that one obtains instead of (2): Rim = l im^l/xl + l i^l ml^ = 0 (3) g = 1 (3a) Here we put: im^l = {im l} (4) which magnitudes we will denote as the "components" of the gravitational field. Then Wv = (c-\-fjL)(c-\)=c'~+{fj, + \)c-,jcX.
Then according to Gauss we have ds2 = g11du2 + 2g12dudv = g22dv2 where g11, g12, g22, are magnitudes which depend in a perfectly definite way on u and v. The magnitudes g11, g12 and g22, determine the behaviour of the rods relative to the u-curves and v-curves, and thus also relative to the surface of the table. Then again curvature depends on the quantity of matter, and hence in the presence of a sufficient quantity of matter space- time may curve round and close up. Then by differentiation and contraction px??? Then by means of the invariants m'^e^, [me) the final values of these vectors, whether they are of the same or of opposite directions, or whether one of them is equal to zero, would be at once settled.
Then by reasoning similar to that followed in (3), it can be shown that ^/^(^;) = l. .-. Then came H. A. Lorentzs great discovery. Then came emancipation, which suddenly opened up undreamed-of possibilities to the individual. Then came the European war, which was a crushing blow to all who had the improvement of human relations in general at heart. Then came the great change, which will be associated for all time with the names of Faraday, Clerk Maxwell, and Hertz. Then came the special theory of relativity with its recognition of the physical equivalence of all inertial systems. Then carne H. A. Lorentz's decisive simplification of the the? Then carne tbe European war, wbich was a crushing blow to aJl who bad t11e improvement of buman relations in gen?
Then carne the growth of the natural sciences, with their great influence on thought and practical lif e, weakening stili more in modem times the religious sentiment of the peoples. Then d(72 = CW If dxi, dx2, dxs are the orthogonal projections of dcT, and the imaginary time co-ordinate \/ ict=X4 is introduced, then the above-mentioned law of the constancy of the propagation of light takes the form ds^ = dxi^ -h dx2^ + dxs^ -h = 0 Since this formula expresses a real situation, we may attribute a real meaning to the quantity ds. Then during a finite time a small disturbing farce acts upon the system. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality.
Then every event which takes place along the line also takes place at a particular point of the train. Then everything concerning shape and size is quite irrelevant. Then everywhere upon the surface we have ds2 = g dx11 12 + 2g dx dx12 1 2 + g dx22 22 where g11, g12, g22 are determined by the nature of the surface and the choice of co-ordinates; if these quantities are known, then it is also known how networks of rigid rods may be laid upon the surface. Then followed the development of the theory in the form of the calculus of tensors, particularly by Ricci and Levi-Civita. Then for (20) we may substitute J::swdx = o 1 But since 2 dx dx,,J w = g,, d X dX . Then for the first time the epoch of theoretical physics founded by Faraday and Maxwell would reach a satisfactory conclusion.
Then for the g,,.. in (13a) we bave to insert the values - 1 o o o o - 1 o o o o - 1 o o o o 1 wherever tbey appear differentiated only once or not at e. We thus obtain in the first piace G,,.. = [,uv, 1) + [.v, 2) + + 2log ,j. Then from the intensity of the waves hitting the screen at some point, we draw conclu? Then h cannot be regarded as a vector.6 The equations may, however, easily be interpreted if h is regarded as a skewsymmetrical tensor of the second rank. Then he set the water in the pipes moving, one in the direction of the light's propagation and the other opposite to it. Then if Pik and P are, respectively, the curvature tensor of the second rank and the curvature scalar in three-dimensional space, we bave G,k = P," (i, k = 1, 2, 3) Gi, = G4 , = G44 = O G = - p - g = 'Ya.
Then if a Lorentz transformation is taken in which the perpendicular from P on A B, or from P on the plane A B C is the axis, and q is the moment, then all the three (or four) events (A, to), [B, to), (C, t,) and (P, t) are simultaneous. Then if the electric and magnetic vectors are i A {x vt) proportional to e , we have ^-=?A, ^- = /A? Then if we introd uce new space-time co-ordinates x1, x 2 , x 3 , x 4 , by roeans of any substi? Then it follows that the equations I), II), III), IV) are transformed into the corresponding system with dashes.
Then it happened that, around the turn of the century, independently of what we have just been discussing, a second fundamental crisis set in, the seriousness of which was suddenly recognized due to Max Planck's investigations into heat radiation (1900). Then it is true that all bodies are in the "space of the (arbitrarily chosen) body A." Then it turns out that certain sense perceptions of different individuals correspond to each other, while for other sense perceptions no such correspondence can be established. Then let us draw the radius rector OA', the tansrent A' B' at A', and let us complete the parallelogram OA' B' C ; also produce W C to meet the f -axis at D'. Then only field-energy would be left, and the particle would be merely an area of special density of field-energy.
Then out of the endeavor to understand inertia and gravita- tion as having a unified character there arose the general theory of relativity, which also avoided those implicit axioms which underlie our thinking when ESSAYS IN SCIENCE 1 14 we use special co-ordinate systems in the process of formulating basic laws. Then rememberinir (40) we can establish the system of equations, which remains invariant for any substitution with determinant 1 (according to our choice of co-ordinates). Then six components are not all indepejident but are connected bv the folio wins' relation Further the contents | <^ | of the piece of a plane is to be defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of these six cpiantities.
Then the 5-eomponent of the vector divergence of /' because the operator lor multiplies /' veetorially) = Div/^,=:Lim ili^. Then the Lorentz transformation is defined in such a way that, first, it makes the equation x12 + x22 + x32 ?l2 = 0 (22b) a co-variant equation, that is, an equation which is satisfied with respect to every inertial system if it is satisfied in the inertial system to which we refer the two given events (emission and reception of the ray of light). Then the Schrodinger equation will furnish the 'ljJ function after the interaction has taken place. Then the current will appear if the magnetic field changes or the circuit is deformed or moved : if the number of magnetic lines passing through the surface is changed, no matter how this change is caused.
Then the electromagnetic fields that make up light no longer appear as a state of a hypothetical medium, but rather as independent entities that the light source gives off, just as in Newton's emission theory of light. Then the equation of the surface is a? Then the equations of motion area, by Newton's law, ?dudt? Then the force-vector exerted by the first election r^ (moving in any possible manner) * Lienard, L'Eolairage electriqne T.16, 1896, p. 53, Wiechert, Ann. Then the formation of Fascist states, attended by a series of broken pacts and undisguised acts of violence against humanity and against weaker nations. Then the integral (7) can be denoted by // vdJn dT=j (t'-t") dm. Then the lengths of all other intervals may be determined.
Then the message, that is, the light ray from the star, will travel more quickly or more slowly, according to the velocity of the star at the moment the ray is emitted. Then the number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down is the required distance. Then the observed half-2:>eriod from B to A is approximately T '^ and from A to B is T + . Then the principle of conservation of mass can be formulated in this manner : For an infinite! Then the projection of this piece of plane on the :)'// plane is given hy the projections ?/,, ?/,^, r^, r,, of the four veetoi:" in the combination Let us form in a similar manner all the six components of this plane <A. Then the propositions of Euclid contain affirmations as to the relations of practically-rigid bodies.
Then the systems of equations in (A) and (B) are transformed into equations (A'), and (B'), the new equations being obtained by simply dashing the old set. Then the vector components A+ Ax? Then there is the further question whether the corpuscles (electrons and protons) can be regarded as positions of particularly dense fields, whose movements are determined by the field equations. Then there would be nothing to stop the cart, so that it would run for ever. Then these magnitudes always fulfil the condition 1) dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c2dt2 = dx1 2 + dy1 2 + dz1 2 - c2dt1 2. Then w = ], and we would get in place of (20c) ^ ^v ^> ^ ^t^v a*" d^c^ ds ds 1 dg d'^ 6^ _i _/^ Ij^ ? Then we have g?g ?0 if If we form the infinitely small quantities (co-variant vectors) (62) d?
Then we have the following relations : 2i^ n, + n^; Uy + n*; n , -f ?^t ?0 =0 ?^* v,-\-u'fj ? Then we have the followinoj relations between the components of the two plane : The proof of these assertions is as follows. Then we obtain (as a picture, so to speak, of the perennial life-career of the substantial point),a curve in the 2Vorldthe ivorld-line, the points on which unambiguously correspond to the para- meter t from -f 00 to <^. Then we shall have a vivid representation of three-dimensional spherical space, or, rather of three-dimensional spherical geometry. Then with respect to K1 there is a gravitational field G (of a particular kind). Then word-groups rather than single words refer to perceptions.
Then {m,, i e,y -\-{7n,, i e^y=^o, Therefore {e^+i m^,)/(e,-\-i e^) is different from +i, and we can therefore define a complex argument <^ + tV) in such a manner that tan(</>-fiV)=?iLt^v^ Vide Note. Then, according to Newton's laws, we know THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS the change in velocity during a short time interval. Then, as we have seen in many other examples, a wave is created by the oscillation which spreads through the tube with a certain velocity. Then, disregarding the influence of the air resistance, I see the stone descend in a straight line. Then, however, we must also give up, by principle, the space-time continuum.
Then, if the averages fa of the individual fa vanish, A2 = S 4 (22) If the mean square values fa\ of the individual momenta are all equal (A|=A2), and if I is the total number of events producing these momenta, the relation A* = lW (22a) holds. Then, if the signals are sent out simultaneously, they will all reach me at the same instant. Then, if there are fi suspended particles present in the volume V*, and therefore %/'V* = V in a unit .of volurne, and if neighbouring particles are suffi- ciently far separated, there will be a corresponding osmotic pressure fi of magnitude given by R T n RT where N signifies the actual number of molecules contained in a gram-molecule.
Then, on the basis of a logical process, the justification of which we feel ourselves compelled to admit, all remaining propositions are shown to follow from those axioms, i.e. Then, relatively to K', a mass sufficiently distant from other masses would have an acceler? Then, taking (40) into consideration, the following equations will be invariant for any substitution whose invariant is unity (in agreement with the cliosen co? Then, the motion must, according to the law of inertia, be uniform. Then, to pack them closely, we should have to use a box each side of which is about one-quarter of a mile long ! Thence it follows that the above assumption for tracts must also hold good for intervals of clock-time in the theory of relativity.
Thence we conclude that a balance-clock7 at the equator must go more slowly, by a very small amount, than a precisely similar clock situated at one of the poles under otherwise identical conditions. Theorem of the Addition of Velocities. Theorems of the latter kind are "statements about reality" or laws of nature, i.e. Theoretical physicists have tried for a long time, therefore, to reach the goal by a modification of Maxwelrs equations. Theories are evolved and are expressed in short compass as statements of a large number of individual observations in the form of empirical laws, from which the general laws can be ascertained by comparison.
Theories of Principles.-But in addition to this most weighty group of theories, there is another group consisting of what I call theories_ of principles. Theory again gives us statements of a statistical nature only. Theory answers: the repelled fluid ( ) can now make its escape through my body, with the result that only one fluid remains, the positive. Theory of Co-prdinate and Time-Transformation from a stationary system to a system which moves relatively to this with uniform velocity. Theory of Doppler's Principle and Aberration. Theory of Dopplers Principle and of Aberration. Theory of Electrons (English edition), ])ages iy7-:iOO, :ioO, also notes 7:j, 86, pages 318, 328.
Theory of the Pressure of Radiation Exerted on Perfect Reflectors Since A2/81 equals the energy of light per unit of volume, we have to regard A02/81, by the principle of relativity, as the energy of light in the moving system. Theory of the Radiation-pressure on a perfect mirror. Theory of the Transformation of Co-ordinates and Times from a Stationary System to another System in Uniform Motion of Translation Relatively to the Former. Theory requires that this rotation should amount to 43 seconds of arc per century for the planet Mercury, but for the other Planets of our solar system its magnitude should be so small that it would necessarily escape detection.
Theory tells us only about the probability of each of these possible transitions, but nothing about the actual transition of an individual atom. There I had excellent teachers (for example, Hurwitz, Minkowski), so that I really could have gotten a sound mathematical education. There are Cartesian co-ordinates, X1, X2, upon such a small portion of the surface, and the distance between two points, measured by a measuring rod, is given by * These considerations assume that the behavior of rods and clocks depends only upon velocities, and not upon accelerations, or, at least, that the influence of acceleration does not counteract that of velocity. There are advantages in isolating that which is purely logical and independent of what is, in principle, incomplete empiricism.
There are analogous relations in the four-dimensional space-time continuum of physics. There are cer- tain psychological obstacles whose exist- ence a layman in the mental sciences may dimly surmise, .but whose interrel- ations and vagaries he is incompetent to fathom ; you, I am convinced, will he able to suggest educative methods, lying more or less outside the scope of politics, which will eliminate these ob- stacles. There are certain callings in our modem organization which entail such an isolated lif e with? There are certain magnitudes which remain constant by any change of axes. There are few enough people with sufficient independence to see the weaknesses and follies of their contemporaries and remain themselves untouched by them.
There are here, also, tensors of any rank, which may have co-variant or contra-variant character with respect to each index; as with vectors, the character is designated by the position of the index. There are many experiments to confirm these two statements and not a single one to contradict either of them. There are many such questions which, from a rational vantage point, cannot easily be answered or cannot be answered at all. There are no antisymmetrical tensors of higher rank tban the fourtb in a continuum of four dimensions. There are no eternal theories in science. There are no forces acting, the existing potential difference having no influence whatever on the position of the needle.
There are now 11 e([uations for finding out 10 functions // , so that the number is more than suffi- cient. There are now certain rules according to which the components can be calculated in a new system of co-ordinates, when these are known for the original system, and when the transformation connecting the two systems is known. There are only a few enlightened people with a lucid mind and style and with good taste within a century. There are pessimists who hold that such a state of affairs is necessarily inherent in human nature; it is those who propound such views that are the enemies of true religion, far they imply thereby that religious teachings are utopian ideals and unsuited to afford guidance in human affairs.
There are several glass tumblers, each containing water with a little sulphuric acid. There are simple means of obtaining sources of homogeneous light. There are stars everywhere, so that the density of matter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless on the average everywhere the same. There are then certain rules by which these cornponents can be calculated for a new systern of co-ordin? There are two quite different motions in- volved, that of the rumour, London to Edinburgh, and that of the persons who spread the rumour. There are two quite different things about this phenomenon which may be described. There are two ways of regarding concepts, both of which are necessary to understanding. There are various ways, such as oiling the wheels, and making the road very smooth.
There are very simple methods for determining specific heats, and the fate of the theory depends on the result of just such measurements. There are, however, two respects in which this economic freedom ought to be limited. There are, however, two respects in which this economie freedom ought to be limited. There are, however, very many double-star systems, consisting of two stars moving around a point, called their centre of gravity. There arises here the same question which we con- sidered in connection with heat. There can be a kind of organizing by which scientists are assured their freedom and proper conditions of work. There can be no empty space if light travels only in a medium.
There can be no space nor any part of space without gravitational potentials; for these confer upon space its metrical qualities, without which it cannot be imagined at all. There can never be complete agreement on international control and the administration of atomic energy or on general disarmament until there is a modification of the traditional concept of national sovereignty. There could be no talk of racial differences. There does arise, however, a strange difficulty. There exist points arbitrarily near every point on the plane. There exist points very near every point of the space. There exist quantities, however, which are the same in both c.s. There exist two electric fluids, one called positive ( 4- ) and the other negative ( ).
There exist, therefore, only six independent components, as is the case in the electromagnetic field. There exists, therefore, for the individual, an 1-time, or subjective time. There followed also the principle of the equivalence of mass and energy, with the laws of conservation of mass and energy becoming one and the same. There he sits, our beloved Planck, and smiles inside himself at my childish playing-about with the lantern of Diogenes. There ie some good ore in Canada and the Soviet Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is the Belgian Congo. There is a break in the path, such as is shown in the drawing. There is a circuit through which a cur- rent flows, with, for instance, a voltaic battery as the source of the current.
There is a gain in picturesqueness in regarding a skew-symmetrical tensor of rank 2 as a vector in space of three dimensions, but it does not represent the exact nature of the corresponding quantity so well as considering it a tensor. There is a kind of conciliation which is a crime against humanity, and it passes for political wisdom. There is a large open space in which there are walking two men holding between them a rigid pole. There is a special kind of space whose physical structure (:field ) we can presume as precisely known on the basis of the special theory of relativity. There is a system of ref erence relatively to which matter may be looked upon as being permanently at rest. There is a vessel containing gas. There is also another reason against it.
There is also another way in which Prohibition, in my opin? There is also another way in which Prohibition, in my opinion, has led to the enfeeblement of the State. There is also one other fundamental problem. There is also some similarity between the mathematical equa- tions governing the acoustical problem and those gov- erning the problem of quantum physics. There is an analogous state of tbings in tbe tbeory of gravitation in generai relativity. There is another aspect even more important. There is another consequence the experimental testing of which seems to me to be of great importance. There is another very important question.
There is good reason for this Jack of definition, in that the wide freedom of the choice of co-ordinates causes the problem to remain mathematically undefined to such a degree that three of tbe functions of space may be chosen at will. There is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to which light is propagated in empty space. There is no absolute (independent of the space of reference) relation in space, and no absolute relation in time between two events, but there is an absolute (independent of the space of reference) relation in space and time, as will appear in the sequel. There is no compromise possible between preparation for war, on the one hand, and preparation of a world society based on law and order on the other.
There is no connection between my having no pencil and your having six oranges, but there is a very real correlation between the distance of the car from the ground and its speed. There is no contraction, however, in the direction perpendicular to the motion. There is no difficulty in connecting Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic field with the theory of the gravitational feld so long as one restricts himself to space, free of ponderable matter and free of electric density. There is no doubt that all but the crudest scientific work is based on a firm belief akin to religious feeling in the rationality and comprehensibility of the world.
There is no doubt that quantum mechanics has seized hold of a beautif ul element of truth, and that it will be a test stone for any future theoretical basis, in that it must be deducible as a limiting case from that basis, just as electrostatics is de? There is no doubt that quantum physics explained a very rich variety of facts, achieving, for the most part, splendid agreement between theory and observation. There is no doubt that this condition has to be abolished if man is to prove himself worthy, at least to some extent, of the self? There is no fundamental difference between Hertzs ether and ponderable matter (which in part subsists in the ether). There is no fundamental distinction between the Hertzian ether and ponder- able matter (which partly consists of the ether).
There is no hope of reducing the optical phenomena to the mechanical ones before this question is answered. There is no inductive method which could lead to the fundamental concepts of physics. There is no logical path to these laws ; only intuition, resting on sympathetic understanding of experience, can reach them. There is no longer a sharp distinction between light and dark. There is no place in quantum physics for statements such as: "This object is so-and-so, has this-and-this property.' There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment; an "army of unemployed" almost always exists. There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment; an ..army of unem?
There is no reason for doubting the simple mechanical transformation law which only states that the velocities have to be added in certain cases and subtracted in others. There is no reason to believe that the result of such measurements will be the same as in the case of a stick at rest. There is no reason to believe that they will behave in the way we should like them to. There is no reason why a nation or a race should not preserve its traditions. There is no room in this for the divinization of a nation, of a class, Iet alone of an individuai. There is no room in this for the divinization of a nation, of a class,!et alone of an individuai. There is no rt7;;wy logical necessity that it should be >^o.
There is no string connecting the earth and the moon, but we can imagine a line be- tween the centres of the two bodies; the force lies along this line and is directed toward the centre of the earth, just as the force on a stone thrown in the air or dropped from a tower. There is no universe beyond the universe for us. There is not one superfluous word in Shaw's prose, just as there is not one superfluous note in Mozart's music. There is not the slightest doubt as to the clarity of this verdict, although it is obtained through rather indirect experiments in view of the great technical diffi- culties caused by the enormous value of the velocity of light. There is not the slightest trace of a law governing their individual behaviour.
There is not the slightest trace of an explanation as to why this is true. There is nothing about a vector to indicate which stations the train passes or on which of the many parallel tracks it is running. There is nothing divine about morality, it is a purely human affair. There is nothing divine about morality; it is a purely human affair. There is nothing especially striking or strange about the arrangement of our clocks. There is nothing irrational in either of these examples except that in both cases we should have to run with a speed of about four hundred yards per second, and we can very well imagine that further technical development will make such speeds possible.
There is nothing mysterious about this, and the last sentence is equally true for classical physics and the relativity theory. There is nothing mysterious or unreasonable in all this. There is obviously no sense in thinking of ether in this way, since all matter is immersed in it and it penetrates everywhere. There is one characteristic feature of our drawing which will be emphasized later. There is one other thing which follows from that concep? There is only one demand to be made of the definition of simultaneity, namely, that in every real case it must supply us with an empirical decision as to whether or not the conception that has to be defined is fulfilled. There is only the magnetostatic field of the bar magnet which does not change with time.
There is really nothing new in what I have to say about this; but innumerable questions addressed to me prove that the requirements of those who thirst for knowledge of these matters have not yet been completely satisfied. There is room for one further general remark. There is something like a Puritan's restraint in the scientist who seeks truth: he keeps away from everything voluntaristic or emotional. There is still a further difficulty in forming a consistent physics for heavy particles, constituting the nuclei. There is still to be taken into account tbe condition that at spatial infinity the potential </> tends toward a fixed limiting value. There is the danger that everyone waits idly far others to act in his stead.
There is the further difficulty that our language is compelled to work with words which are inseparably connected with those primitive concepts. There is therefore a definite meaning in speaking of the numerical equality of the linear elements PG and P'G'. There is too much education altogether, especially in American schools. There is yet another factor underlying the evolu- tion of the general theory of relativity. There is, at this point, a wide gulf between common sense and classical physics. There is, how- ever, an essential difference between this case and that of heat, matter or energy. There is, however, a danger that the problem of educating for peace may be handled from an emotional, rather than a realistic standpoint.
There is, however, a somber point in the social outlook of Americans. There is, however, one other human right which is infrequently mentioned but which seems to be destined to become very important: this is the right, or the duty, of the individua! There is, of course, a certain connection between those ele? There is, of course, no current now ! There is, therefore, no choice of co-ordinates for which the metrical relations of the special theory of relativity hold in a finite region. There is, therefore, no escape, and you give the following information: "Mr. N. is a cheerful, straightforward man, much liked by all his friends.
There is, therefore, sense in asking whether those equations are true or not, as well as in asking what the true equations of transformation are by which we pass from one inertial system K to another, K', moving relatively to it. There it lies, this gold, carefully protected against theft, a monument to governmental wisdom and to economie science I The reasons which I have just indicated make it difficult for me to take the alleged exploitation of the world by the United States very seriously. There may be some hope of explaining this phenomenon by the interaction between the elec- tron and the rim, though such an explanation does not seem to be very promising. There must be a deeper reason for this.
There must be an end to the concept of non-intervention, for to end it is part of keeping the peace. There must be treaties guaranteeing that the decisions of this court shall be made effective by all the nations acting in concert. There must be two observers to take note of simultaneous events in different parts of the given c.s. There must exist an average speed of molecules, just as in a large human community there exists an average age, or an average wealth. There remains (38) a"^= %^- + i"^ '} A''-/^+ ^^ " j A''^ This is the expression for the extension of a contravariant tensor of the second rank; extensions can also be formed -for corresponding- contravni'iant tensors of higher and lower ranks.
There remains at the bottom of every thesis and of every proof some remainder of the dogma of in fallibility. There seems to be only one way out of all these difficulties. There seems, therefore, to be no reason to han the following interpretation of the latter case. There still remains the question of colour. There still would remain the possibility of an armament race with regard to a possible future war, and there always exists the tempta? There then exist for the frequency of occurrence of different sets of values of A? There too the beneficent influence of this intelligent, humane, and modest personality, whose unspoken but faithfully followed advice is, "Not mastery but service," will lead people in the right way.
There was also the English brewer Joule who, in his spare time, performed some most important experiments con- cerning the conservation of energy. There was another group of observed phenomena which could scarcely be fitted into a Newtonian scheme of XVI PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY dynamics without doing violence to it. There was little material for the confirmation of this law when it was first proposed (1905), and eleven years elapsed before Prof. Millikan established, by a set of experiments scarcely rivalled for the ingenuity, skill, and care displayed, the absolute truth of the law. There was no need to accept fascist Argentina into the U. N. against Russia's opposition.
There was no need to manufacture new atomic bombs without letup and to appropriate twelve billion dollars for defense in a year in which no military threat was to be ex? There was not, strictly speaking, any all-embracing foundation, because an explicit law was formulated only for the actions-at-a-distance of gravitation; while for other actions-at-a-distance nothing was established a priori except the law of equality of actio and reactio. There was something fascinating about this idea to me, but it provided no workable basis for a new theory. There was the artificial character of the electric and magnetic fluids. There was the jelly- like medium in which the transverse wave spread.
There was the longitudinal wave caused by the pulsating sphere, where the changes of density were propagated through the medium. There was the unnoticed clue in classical mechanics of the equality of gravitational and inertial mass. There was the versatile Scotsman Black, the German physician Mayer, and the great American adventurer Count Rumford, who afterwards lived in Europe and, among other activities, became Minister of War for Bavaria. There was, for example, the planet Mars ; and the length of the Martian year i.e., one rotation of Mars around the sun was known. There was, in the interaction between electric current and magnetic needle, an unsolved difficulty. There we confided our experiences, ambitions, emotions to each other.
There were alto- gether only two examinations; aside from these, one could just about do as one pleased. There were several outstandmg difficulties in connec- tion with anomalous dispersion, selective reflection and selective absorption which could not be satisfactory explained in the classic electromagnetic theory. There were two types of problems that engaged his attention. There will therefore^ be an average kinetic energy per particle. There would be attraction at one end, repulsion at the other, and a balancing of equal and opposite forces in the middle. There would be no Brdwnian motion at all if the bombarding molecules did not possess a certain amount of energy or, in other words, if they did not have mass and velocity.
There would be no comfortable houses for the mass of the people, no railway, no wireless, no protection against epidemics, no cheap books, no culture and no enjoyment of art for all. There would be no equilibrium between gas and radiation. There would be no machines to relieve the people from the arduous labor needed for the production of the essential necessities of life. There, too, the beneficent influence of this wise, humane, and modest personality, whose unspoken but faithfully followed device is, "Not mastery but service," will lead people on the right way. There- fore, through the interruption of a current, a magnetic field disappeared. Thereby it may appear more intelligible.
Thereby the forms under which the physical laws come forth, gain in intelligibility, as I shall presently show. Thereby we achieve an important simplification in all our formulas and calculations, without renouncing the conditions of general covariance, as we have obtained the equations through a specialisation of the co-ordinate system from the general c'ovariant-equations. Therefare one shuuld guard against preaching to the young man success in the customary sense as the aim of !ife. Therefare the school and the teacher must guard against em? Therefore : a changing magnetic field is accompanied by an electric field. Therefore : the external force is also a vector, and must have the same direction as the change in velocity.
Therefore Det-/be- comes an invariant in the case of a Lorentz transformation . Therefore F = O, and, in consequence, t. But the left-hand side of the equation must vanish, since botb , a.nd ,,I - g dr are invariants. Therefore dB J dB' - TfT But from the molecular theory of Heat given in the paper quoted, (*) it is easily deduced that d B /B (4) (or dB'/B respectively) is equal to the probability that at any arbitrary moment of time the centres of gravity of the particles are included in the domains (dx, . Therefore for every direction through P let there be a definite di- rection through P', and let this mutual relation be a determinate one. Therefore for ma^^netised bodies, Loreutz's equations do not correspond to the Relativity Principle.
Therefore for the space-time point considered, there arises as in 4, the new values 28) o)\ = 0, i^'^^O, o)'q = 0, (ii\=zi^ therefore the new velocity vector oj' = o, the space-time point is as if transformed to rest. Therefore give heed to your clever and patriotic women-folk and remember that the Capitol of mighty Rome was once saved by the cackling of its faithful geese. Therefore give heed to your clever and patriotic womenfolk and remem- 8 IDEAS AND OPINIONS ber that the Capito!of mighty Rame was once saved by the cackling of its faithful geese. Therefore it is clear that, for a gravitational field free from matter, it is desirable that the symmetrical ten- sors B deduced from the tensors B^^ should vanish.
Therefore it is compelled not only to cultivate a technical-military training and type of thinking but also to implant a spirit of national vanity in.its people in order to secure their inner readiness for the out? Therefore it so happens that by a compensation of two contradictions to the relativity principle, the differential equations of Lorentz for movinG" non-masi'netised bodies at last ao-ree with the relativity postulate. Therefore na ve realism, if true, is false; therefore it is false. Therefore naive realism, if true, is false; therefore it is false.E Apart from their masterful formulation these lines say something which had never previously occurred to me. Therefore one can derive the law of blackbody radiation from the function ?, and, inversely, one can derive the function ?
Therefore one sbould guard against preacbing to the young man success in tbe customary sense as the aim of lif e. For a successful man is be who receives a great deal from his fel? Therefore people will not disarm step by step; they will disarm at one blow or not at all. Therefore pocket your temperament and keep your manuscript for your sons and daughters, m order that they may derive consolation from it and not give a damn for what their teachers tell them or think of them. Therefore referring to the expression (37), we have the identity DetMA/A) = Det A. Det"/. Therefore the T; are the energy-components of the electromagnetic feld. Therefore the deep impression which classi- cal thermodynamics made upon me.
Therefore the difference of the two integrals /v^/ (the first being extended over the upper, the second upon the lower boundary) vanishes. Therefore the general relations k, k being unequal indices in the series 1, 2, 3, 4, and (81) S/ji Si/, + S/,2 Sg/, +S/, 3 S3/,-{-Sa4^, S^/, =:L''^ Det ^/ Det ^'f, for/^ = l, 2, .3, 4. Therefore the linear orthogonal transformations are the only ones by means of which we can pass from one Cartesian system of co-ordinates in our space of reference to another. Therefore the observers stationed with the watches will not find the clocks Fj-nchrouous, thoiio-h the observer in the stationarv system must declare the clocks to be svnehronous.
Therefore the question whether the universe is spatially finite or not seems to me decidedly a pregnant question in the sense of practical geometry. Therefore the theorem is proved. Therefore those who desire to encourage the growth of an international spirit and to combat chauvinism must take their stand against compulsory service. Therefore to support "Working Palestine" is at the same time to promote a humane and worthy policy in Palestine, and to oppose an effective resistance to those undercurrents of narrow nationalism from which the whole political world, and in a less degree the small political world of Palestine affairs, is suffering. Therefore we say that the spherical surface of the globe is an unbounded continuum.
Therefore we see that according to our theory, it is possible to obtain the velocity of an electron from the ratio of the magnetic deflexion Am, and the electric deflexion A^, by applying the law : ^ =- . Therefore, I believe one must conclude the following from the above formula derived from Planck's radiation formula: In addition to the spatial irregularities in the distribution of radiation's energy that arise from the oscillation theory, there are also other irregularities in the same spatial distribution that completely dominate the first-mentioned irregularities when the energy density of the radiation is small. Therefore, according to the fundamental principles of the theory, the number of configurations is not an expression for the probability in Boltzmann's sense.
Therefore, again to the same approximation, Q(V) = gf^'H v' cosq>') or Q(V) = e(v') + -J-(v') - v' cos ?.'. Therefore, although the source of light is rigidly connected with my c.s., the velocity of light will not be the same in all directions. Therefore, by equation (1), we cannot arrive at a theory of the electron by restricting ourselves to the electro? Therefore, from the pbydcal sta11dpoint, the assumption readly suggests itself tha.t the systems K and K' may both wth equa! Therefore, heat-energy is created in the wire. Therefore, here the classical theory still yields a fairly good approximation. Therefore, in addition to masses and temporally variable distances, there must be something else that determines motion.
Therefore, in arder to demonstrate that A>'" is a tensor if any covariant vector is inserted on the right-ahand side for A, we only need show that this is so far the vector S. But far this latter purpose it is sufficient, as a glance at the right? Therefore, in the case we are considering, dynamic equilibrium is possible only when each oscillator has the average energy E. We shall now proceed to present a similar argument regarding the interaction between the oscillators and the radiation present in the cavity. Therefore, on account of the lack of uniformity in the distribution of matter, the metrica! Therefore, pocket your temperament and keep your manu? Therefore, the change of velocity is an invariant, though only, of course, on condition that the relative motion of our two c.s.
Therefore, the constitution of radiation seems to be different from what our oscillation theory predicts. Therefore, the escaping wall will be met by the signal a little later than the approaching one. Therefore, the number ?s of cells belonging to a certain elementary domain ?E of energy is (2). Therefore, the number of molecules in each must be the same, although the gases are chemically different. Therefore, the pres- sure in the liquid is greater on the left than on the right when the velocity is greater on the right than on the left. Therefore, the speed of propagation in the object will again be V. However, taken absolutely, i.e., relative to an observer not moving with the object, the speed of propagation will be the geometric sum of V and the velocity v of the object.
Therefore, whence it follows that the time marked by the clock (viewed in the stationary system) is slow by 1 seconds per second, orNneglecting magnitudes of fourth and higher orderNby . Therefore, with respect to K', we have the equation (x'? Therefore, with respect to molecular energy, pressure, and statistical distribution each component behaves as if it were the only one present. Therefore: The world of events forms a four-dimensional continuum. Therefore: the distance between the two bodies and the floor will not change. Therein lies the physical foundation for the second term of the lef t-hand side of (1).
Thereupon Bohr in the year 1913 devised an interpretation of the simplest spectra on quantum-theory lines, for which he in a short time produced such a mass of quantitative confirmation that the boldly selected hypothetical basis of his speculations soon became a mainstay for the physics of the atom. Thereupon my visitar, very calmly and coolly, said to me: 'Why are you so deeply op? Thereupon my visitor, very calmly and coolly, said to me: "Why are you so deeply opposed to the disappearance of the human race? Thereupon we put the queston-What is the reason for this difference in the two bodies ?
These and certain other types of knowledge are, so to speak, a part of the implements of thinking and therefore do not previously have to be gained from sense data (i.e., they are a priori knowledge). These and certain other types of knowledge are, so to speak, a part of the. These are all symmetrical in o-, and r. The same is true for the sum uf the second and third members. These are eleven equations for defining the ten functions g, so that these functions appear over-defined. These are four equations which the energy-components of ma.tter have to satiisfy. These are old sayings, coined by men for whom human personality was the highest human good. These are rather artificial concepts, and quite unrelated to the fundamental substance, mass.
These are tbe g.,,T; = T"'and g1111T; = T 01lare to be symmetrical tensors. These are the chief characteristics of modern quantum physics. These are the general tield- ecpiations of gravitation in the mixed form. These are the lines offorce of the gravitationalfield. These are the obstacles which confront us when we try to describe the essential nature of the pre-scientific concept of space. These are the so-called axial vectors which transform differently, from a right-handed system to a left-handed system, from the x?. These are the two limiting possibilities. These attempt to build a picture of complex phenomena out of some relatively simple proposition. These attempts have, however, not been crowned with suc? These axioms are free creations of the human mind.
These can no longer be dependent on the orientation and the state of motion of the " local " system of co-ordinates, for ds2 is a quantity ascertainable by rod-clock measurement of point? These changes of density are propagated throughout the entire medium. These clocks are therefore Osynchronous in the stationary system.O We imagine further that with each clock there is a moving observer, and that these observers apply to both clocks the criterion established in 1) for the synchronization of two clocks. These clocks satisfy only the one condition, that the "readings" which are observed simultaneously on adjacent clocks (in space) differ from each other by an indefinitely small amount.
These co- ordinates have, with a given orientation of the S3^stem, an immediate physical significance in the sense of the special relativity theory (when we take a rigid rod as our unit of measure), llie expression (1) ds'^ = -dX,^ -dX^ 2 -dX^ ' +^X^ had then, according to the special relativity theory, a value which may be obtained by space-time measurement, and which is independent of the orientation of the local co-ordinate system. These cofactors, divided by g, will be denoted by g? These concepts are all free inventions. These concepts are intended to correspond with the objective reality, and by means of these concepts we picture this reality to ourselves.
These concepts must be defined for each reference frame, and it is not self-evident that these definitions will produce the same time values in two frames K and K' moving relative to one another. These conclusions all follow from the assumption that the moving c.s. These conclusions are drawn from the classical trans- formation and can be confirmed by experiment. These conditions do not obtain in Germany at the present time. These conditions would not be harmf ul if the exports were balanced by imports of about the same value. These conflicts bave ali sprung from fatai errors. These constraints obviously express themselves in the two equations , (6) , (7) where Es indicates the energy of a molecule belonging to the s-th phase cell.
These corpuscles must travel along straight lines through empty space with a known speed, bringing to our eyes messages from the bodies emitting light. These data must be supplemented by such a definition of time that, in virtue of this definition, these time-values can be regarded essentially as magnitudes (results of measurements) capable of observation. These decisive progresses were paid for by the coordination of atomistic entities to the mate? These differences must really be of so low an order of magnitude that the stellar velocities generated by tbem do not exceed the velocities actually observed. These differentiations seem to me to be necessary for enabling us to characterise the present day position of the electro-dynamics for moving bodies.
These difficulties can be avoided by the following postulate: natural laws are to be formulated in such a way that their form is identical for coordinate systems of any kind of states of motion. These difficulties can be solved only when our great eco? These disribute themselves over the ?s cells. These distant masses and their motions relative to 81 and 82 must then be regarded as the seat of the causes (which must be susceptible to observation) of the different behaviour of our two bodies 81 and 82 They take over the r le of the factitious cause R1 Of all imaginable spaces R1, R2, etc., in any kind of motion relatively to one another, there is none which we may look upon as privileged a priori without re?
These distant masses, (and their relative motion as* regards the bodies under con- sideration) are then to be looked upon as the seat of the principal observable causes for the different behaviours- GENERALISED THEORY OE RELATIVITY .93 , of the bodies under consideration. These eight people are to meet once a week. These employ the analytic, not the syn- thetic, method. These employ the analytic, not the synthetic method. These entities do not take for granted any knowledge or intuition whatever, but they presuppose only the validity of the axioms, such as the one stated above, which are to be taken in a purely formal sense, i.e.

These equations yield Newton's equations of gravitational mechanics as an approximate law and in addition certain small effects which have been confirmed by observation (deflection of light by the gravitational field of a star, influence of the gravitational potential on the frequency of emitted light, slow rotation of the elliptic circuits of planets-peri? These experi- mental facts contradicted the philosophical view that all forces must act on the line connecting the particles and can depend only upon distance.
These experiments formed a strong support for the theory in which corpuscles belonging to each colour behave as unchangeable substances. These exports are financed through loans which the United States is granting foreign countries. These facts are sufficient to indicate how a simple mechanical theory of light could be devised. These facts may be expressed in other terms. These facts must, in my opinion, be taken as a convincing proof of the correctness of the theory. These facts often seem quite strange, incoherent, and wholly unrelated. These features are of fundamental importance from the point of view of the physical interpretation, and will be encountered again in the solutions to be considered later.
These few simple theorems form the apparatus from the theory of invariants for building the equations of pre-relativity physics and the theory of special relativity. These forces are different for corpuscles belonging to different colours, being strongest for the violet and weakest for the red. These functions are only supposed to determine in a mathematical way the probabilities of encountering those objects in a particular place or in a particular state of motion, if we make a measurement. These fundamental concepts and postulates, which cannot be further reduced logically, form the essential part of a theory, which reason cannot touch. These fundamental laws, together with Newton's law for gravitational force, form the basis of the mechanics of celes?
These fundamental questions are forced upon physics by experiment. These human rights are nowadays recognized theoretically, al? These ideals religion attempts to attain by exerting an educational inluence on tradition and through the development and promulgation of certain easily accessible thoughts and narratives (epics and myths) which are apt to inlu? These ideas greatly in- fluenced the development of physics until nearly a hundred years ago, when their discarding was forced by new evidence, new facts and theories, which in their turn formed a new background for science. These inadequate remarks can give the reader only a vague notion of the important idea contributed by Minkowski. These institutions provide no security for any country in case of an attack on it.
These investigations, however, led to a result which raised my strong suspicions. These last can aid in the great work of restoring the international societies to health by keeping in close touch with like-minded people all over the world and resolutely championing the international cause in their own spheres. These last form the basis for the derivation of deductions from the special theory of relativity, and in themselves they are nothing more than the expression of the universal validity of the law of transmission of light for all Galileian systems of reference. These latter, by the way, are free inventions of the human intellect, which cannot be justified either by the nature of that intellect or in any other fashion a priori.
These lines are circles surrounding the wire and lying on the plane perpendicular to that in which the wire is situated. These most rapid parts of the water will be driven by the circular motion towards the right-hand wall, while the left-hand wall gets the water which comes from the region near the bottom and has a specially low velocity. These motions were such as to satisfy me, after frequently repeated observation, that they arose neither from current in the fluid nor from its gradual evaporation, but belonged to the particle itself. These motors only have to overcome the small amount of friction which the cylinders en- counter from the surrounding air and in their bear- ings.
These no tion of such a setting rests exclusively on the fact that, by means of such concepts and mental relations between them, we standing" of their connection ; but even tions and relations, although free mental the concept of the "real external world" creations, appear to us as stronger and of everyday thinking rests exclusively on more unalterable than the individual sense impressions. These notions and relations, although free statements of our thoughts, appear to us as stronger and more unalterable than the individuai sense experience itself, the character of which as anything other than the result of an illusion or hallucination is never completely guaranteed.

These points A and B of the embankment can be determined by applying the definition of time given in Section 8.

These questions have already been treated in detail and with unsurpassable lucidity by Helmholtz and PoincarZ, whereas I can only touch on them briefly here. These questions, although exceeding the bounds of physics, are intimately related to it, since science forms the material from which they arise. These reasons would not, in themselves, involve the severing of my relations with the Bavarian Academy.

We shall have a 4x4 series m^itrix in which all tJie elements except those on the dia^'onal from left up to right clown are zero, and the elements in this Jia':^onal agree with each other, and are each equal to the above mentioned combination in (36). These remarks necessarily sound vague and pointless until illustrated by examples quoted from the history of physics. These requirements and ideals comprise the nature of the European spirit. These result from the following discussion.
These results are obtained in an exceedingly simple manner, and the effects indicated, which are due to the relative motion of the earth with reference to those fixed stars are found to be in accord with experience. These results supported at the same time mechanics as the foundation of physics and of the atomic hypothesis, which latter was already firmly anchored in chemistry. These results were already reached by Lorentz in the course of further developments of his electron theory. These satisfy the same conditions as the u-curves, they are provided with numbers in a corresponding manner, and they may likewise be of arbitrary shape.
These semivectors are, after ordinary vectors, the simplest mathematical fields that are possible in a metrical continuum of four dimensions, and it looks as if they described, in an easy manner, certain essential properties of elec- trical particles. These solutions involve the mathematical representation of physical space by a space of two identical sheets, a particle being represented by a "bridge" connecting these sheets. These spatial relations are obviously real in the same sense as the bodies themselves. These spatial states, to-day called fields, if their geometrica!structure and interdependet ac? These students are aware of the fact that the destiny of the new generation will be deCided in these few years.
These then are the essential points in our chain of reasoning: change of magnetic field -> induced cur- rent-emotion of charge -> existence of an electric field. These theorems are partially definitions of the concepts ( and of the statements derived logically from them ) and partially theo? These theorems lead us to the following simple rule ; if the i^ijdem of 'reference he changed in an// loay^ then the supposed force is to be put as a force in, the new sjMce- coordinates in such a manner, that the corresponding vector with the components tX ^'Y, tZ, tT, ivhere T= f4x + ^Y + ^z"^ = ^ {the rate of c^ \ t t t ) c^ tohicli work is done at the toorld-point), remains unaltered. These theoretical assumptions are sufficient to explain the three experiments described.
These theories avoid the explicit introduction of materiai points by :fctions which, in the light of the foundation of classica! These three relationships are a complete expression for the laws according to which, by the theory here advanced, the electron must move. These tokens of an international way of thinking and feeling are particularly welcome; for the world is to-day more than ever in need of international thinking and feeling by its leading nations and personalities, if it is to progress towards a better and more worthy future. These treaties are necessary, but are not in themselves sufficient. These tw^o assumptions are quite sufficient to give us a simple and consistent theor^^ of electrodynamics of movino' bodies on the basis of the Maxwellian theory for a t,' bodies at rest.
These two clues together determine the wave-length corresponding to a moving electron. These two consequences, which hold, mutatis mutandis, for every system of reference, form the physical content, free from convention, of the Lorentz transformation. These two illusions cannot be overcome independently. These two modes of application of mechanics belong to the so-called "phenomenological " physics. These two numbers are then the " Cartesian co-ordinates " of this corner with reference to the " Cartesian co-ordinate system" which is determined by the arrangement of little rods. These two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on MaxwellOs theory for stationary bodies.
These two principles lead to certain unambiguous transformation equations characterized by the identity x2 + y2 + z2 - c2 t2 = (x')2 + (y')2 + (z')2 - c2 (t')2 for an appropriate choice of initial origins. These two principles we define as follows: 1) The laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are notaffected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems of co-ordinates in uniform translatory motion. These two quantities, so different according to their defnition, are according to experi? These two tracts are said to be "equal to one another" if the boundaries of the one tract can be brought to coincide permanently with the boundaries of the other.
These two tracts are said to be equal to one another if the boundaries of the one tract can be brought to coincide permanently with the boundaries of the other. These ucurves must not intersect each other, and through each point of the surface one and only one curve must pass. These vanish then also in the region considered, with reference to every other co-ordinate svstem. These we denote as the inner product of the tensor A ^ fXV and B . These we designate as u-curves, and we indicate each of them by means of a number.
These were errors of thought which cost me two years of excessively hard work, until I finally recognized them as such at the end of 1915 and succeeded in linking the question up with the facts of astronomical experience, after which I ruefully returned to the Riemannian curva- ture. These were the primitive precursors of the idea of God. These were the principle of the conservation of energy and the principle of the conser? These words sound like an invitation to you to walk out of this lecture. These workers are a selection, made on a voluntary basis, from the whole Jewish nation, an Zlite composed of strong, confident, and unselfish people. These young people must be helped as much as possible in their struggle.
They all traverse interplanetary space and the atmosphere in unison and give the effect of white light. They allow us to increase our knowledge of the field by small steps. They also show us that the general relativity theory leads to a further generalization of time and space concepts. They are "good" clocks and are synchronized, which means that they show the same time simultaneously. They are ; (1) The Differential Equations :which contain no constant referring to matter : (i) Curl m r = C, (u) div e =]p. ot {Hi) Curl E -f ^ = o, (tr) Div M = o. They are derived from our inbom tendencies to avoid pain and annihilation, and from the accumulated emotional reaction of individuals to the behavior of their neighbors.
They are determined to inHuence the pace of events within the framework of their possibilities. They are expressible in a similar way for gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces. They are if the synchronized clocks in their vicinity show the same time at the instant the events happen. They are immediately given by our intuition (man moving relative to ship and shore) and apparently nothing can be wrong here! They are not ignorant labourers who sell the labour of their hands to the highest bidder, but educated, intellectually vigorous, free men, from whose peaceful struggle with a neglected soil the whole Jewish nation are the gainers, directly and indirectly. They are not our equals in intelligence, sense of responsibility, reliability."
They are somewhat like substance in the sense already explained, in that the amount can be enlarged or diminished, but the total in any isolated system is preserved. They are the components of the gravitational field. They are three logically independent rules, revealing no inner connection with each other. They are to provide work, training, and hygiene in the sphere of the mind. They are transformed and lose the ambiguity associ- ated with them in ordinary language, gaining in rigor- ousness so that they may be applied to scientific thought. They assumed that light played merely a releasing role in the process, and that the molecular energies produced were of a radioactive nature.
They attempt to build up a picture of the more complex phenomena out of the materials of a relatively simple formal scheme from which they start out. They bombard the walls and the piston, bouncing back like balls thrown against a wall. They can convince themselves of this on every part of their " world," provided they do not use too small a piece of it. They can proceed with some hope that once the Russians see they cannot prevent such a regime they may join it. They cancel each other in the expression for 3H, when they are multiplied by F q, which is symmetrical with respect to /x and ft so that only the first member of the bracket remains for our consideration.

They could further decide upon the terms of election for establishing and maintaining these bodies.
They detach themselves and slowly move towards the center of the cross-section of the stream, distribut- ing themselves over a layer of increasing thickness. They do not mix; each pre- serves its individuality regardless of the others. They do not, as in Newton's laws, connect two widely separated events; they do not connect the happenings here with the conditions there. They exist with the same necessity and matter-of-factness as he him? They exist with the same necessity and matter-of-factness as he himself. They found a residual i)erihelion motion of this planet of the given magnitude which can not be explained by the perturbation of the other planets.
They further yield an explanation for the expanding motion a of galactic systems, which is manifested by the red-shift of the light omitted from these systems. They give the equations of materiai phenomena completely, if tbe latter is capable of being characterized by four differ? They give, in theory, a complete solution of the problem of motion, since the four equations (57a), together. They greedily lapped up the splendid triumphs which the art and science of the Western world had achieved. They had faith in the amelioration of human society, respect for every honest opinion, the tolerance far which our great minds had lived and fought. They had faith in the amelioration of human society, respect for every honest opinion, the tolerance for which our classics had lived and fought.
They have a responsible President who is elected for a sufficiently long period and has sufficient powers to be really responsible. They have shown us once more how strong the bond is which unites the Jews of all countries in a common destiny. They have the same form as the equations with respect to the original system of coordinates. They joined in the process with burning enthusiasm, themselves making contributions of lasting value. They led to the formulation of the mechanical point of view. They look upon events in retrospect with the idea that they can define exactly the causes that led up to this or that outstanding event. They make obvious, however, the deep estrangement among the intellectuals of our two countries which is the result of a regrettable and artifcial mutual isola?
They manipulate with a small number of inde? They manipulate with a small number of independently introduced concepts, respectively symbols, such as the integral number, the straight line, the point, as well as with signs which designate the fundamental operations, that is the connections between those fundamental concepts. They may not be thought of as consisting of particles which allow themselves to be separately tracked through time. They mix again when the rubber rod is removed, as fluids of opposite kinds attract each other. They must eventually disappear as irrelevant.
They must ever remain the unproductive exploitation of men and material and an encroachment on the economic reserves of a state through the temporary conscription of men in the active periods of their lives not to mention the moral impairment resulting from a pre occupation with the profession of war and the moral processes of preparing a nation for it. They must not be thought of as consisting of particles, whose course can be followed out separately through time. They must, therefore, be examined more closely. They not only reject it in the range of atomic energy: they reject it sharply on principle, and thus have spurned in advance any overture to join a limited world government. They received the following answer. They remain apart even after the rod is removed.
They say further, and truly, that the greatest obstacle to international order is that monstrously exaggerated spirit of nationalism which also goes by the fair-sounding but misused name of patriotism. They seek to fulfill this great task by spreading moral and cultura! They seized for themselves a monopoly of the Iand ownership and appointed a priesthood from among their own ranks. They seized for themselves a monopoly of the land ownership and appointed a priesthood from among their own ranks. They serve only to make statistica!statemeiits and predictions of the results of all measurements which we can carry out upon the system. They should be free to stay out, and though they should feel perfectly secure in staying out, I am sure they would wish to join.
They should help the young person to grow up in such a spirit that these fundamental principles should be to him as the air which he breathes. They suggest rather that, as has already been shown to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good.1 We will raise this conjecture (the purport of which will hereafter be called the OPrinciple of RelativityO) to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former, namely, that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. They take the place of the imaginary cause R^.
They undertake not to espouse the sectional interests of their profession or nation but conscientiously and to the best of their power to aim at the welfare of the whole population of the country. They were not Negroes but white men who had been taken captive in war. They were particularly influenced by the electro-dynamical investigations of Heinrich Hertz. They were poor, without political rights, separated from the Gentiles by a barrier of religious traditions, habits of life, and legal restrictions; their intellectual development was restricted to their own literature, and they had remained almost unaffected by the mighty advance of the European intellect which dates from the Renaissance. They will call the line joining the free ends of these lines a " circle."
They would have to have advisers, but these advisers should only advise when asked. Things grew even worse than a pessimist of the deepest dye would bave dared prophesy. Think especially of Lieben, who, with his Fleming valve, invented an incomparable detector organ for electric waves which simultaneously turned out to be an ideally simple instrument for the creation of electric waves. Think of waves on the surface of water. Third, the General Assembly should remain in session. This " condensed " or excess portion of ether is supposed to be carried away with its own piece of movino" matter. This "contractile^"' formula follows immediately as a direct consequence of the new Theory of Relativity, without any assumption as regards the electrical origin of inertia.
This "wondering" seems to occur when an experience comes into conflict with a world of con- cepts which is already sufficiently fixed in us. This 4-vector may also be expressed in terms of the mass m, and the velocity of the body, considered as a material particle. This Commission is to be an absolutely international and entirely nonpolitical authority, whose business it is to put the intellectuals of all the nations, who were isolated by the war, into touch with each other. This Fitz-Gerald contraction^, startling enough in itself, does not suffice. This IS the age-old problem with which Plato, as one of the fust, sggled s hard: to apply reason and prudence to the solu? This Newtonian basis proved eminently fruitf ul and was regarded as final up to the end of the nineteenth century.
This acceleration or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving body of the gravitational field prevailing relatively to K. It is known that a gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in this way, so that our consideration supplies us with nothing essentially new. This ad d ress preced ed his lecture, "Fundamental Concepts in Physics and Their Develop? This ad dress was pu blished in Mein Weltbild, Amsterd am: Querid o Verlag, 1934. This ad- mirable triumph of reasoning gave the human intel- lect the necessary confidence in itself for its subsequent achievements. This advance in method arises from the fact that the electric and magnetic fields lose their separate existences through the relativity of motion.
This agreement goes so far, that up to the preseat we have been able to find only a few deductions from the general theory of relativity which are capable of investigation, and to which the physics of pre-relativity days does not also lead, and this despite the profound difference in the fundamental assumptions of the two theories. This alone is on my mind in supporting the idea of ..World Government,', without any regard to what other people may have in mind when working for the same objective. This also can be easily genernlized to the case of covariant and contravariant tensors of any rank.
This also holds for the generalised relativity theory for any part of the four-dimen- sional region, in which the co-ordinates Ko can be^ and are, so chosen that (j /s have special constant values of the expression (4). This also is a consequence of Rowland's experiment. This also may be done in various ways, from which we choose the simplest and most convenient. This amounts to introducing in place of the g&" the cofactors Lg~] of the g~ in g in order to avoid the occurrence of denominators. This amounts to the following law:* That in general^ Laws of I^ature are e:fpressed hy means of equations which are valid for all co-ordinate systems^ that is, which are covariant for all possible transformations.
This and many other similar phenomena can be explained only by the assumption that light waves are transverse and not longitudinal ! This anti-sun would of course be equally large and equally bright if there is no absorption of hght in free space. This apostle of justice has written about unexpiated political crimes with devoted industry, high courage, and exemplary fairness, and has done the co=unity a signal service by his books.

This appearance of dark and light stripes in the case of two holes and of light and dark rings in the case of one hole should be borne in mind, for we shall later return to a discussion of the two different pictures. This appears all the more unsatisfactory inasmuch as, according to Maxwell's the- ory, the magnetic field of a moving electric charge repre- sents inertia. This applies as well to the first attempts at writing of the primary boy as to the doctor's thesis on graduation from the university, or as to the mere memarizing of a poem, the writ?
This applies as well to the frst attempts at writing of the primary boy as to the doctor's thesis on graduation from the university, or as to the mere memorizing of a poem, the writing of a composition, the interpretation and translation of a text, the solving of a mathematical prob? This applies most of all to the great artist, but also in a lesser degree to the scientist. This applies most of all to the great artist, but also in a!esser degree to the scientist. This applies not only to scientific description, but also to everyday life. This applies particularly to GI'" the tensor just developed, which plays a fundamental part in the theory to be set forth. This applies particularly to the fundamental principle of the sanctification of life.

This applies today in an even higher degree than in former times, far through modem development of the economie life, the family as bearer of tradition and education has been weakened. This argument is fallacious because, similar to gaseous pressure, the radiation pressure on the plate cannot be considered constant in time and free of irregular variations. This arrangement does not even need to be of such a kind that we must regard x1, x2, x3, as "space" co-ordinates and x4, as a " time " co-ordinate. This association I can define by means of a clock by comparing the order of events furnished by the clock with the order of the given series of events.
This assumption is a physical hypothesis about the the of propagation of light: it must certainly be fulfilled if we are to maintain the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo. This attempt Ieads to the theory of relativity (evolution of e notion of space and time into that of the continuum with metric structure ) . This attitude, however, appears to me to be religious, in the highest sense of the word. This axiom T call the Principle of Relativity. This barometer is low at the present moment, as we are painfully aware from the way we are treated. This bedbug may be gifted with analysis, he may study physics, he may even write a book. This began in the nineteenth century when the wave-theory of light established itself under the pressure of observed fact.
This behaviour is formulated in a law, which is always valid, no matter how the reference-body (mollusc) used in the description may be chosen. This behaviour of the equations of a straight line can be expressed by saying that the equation of a straight line is co-variant with respect to linear orthogonal transformations. This being a complicated case, we take the simpler ease of lor .s^, w^here s- is a fonr-veetor= | .9^, s^. This belief is and always will remain the fundamental motive for all scientific crea- tion. This blow toworld trade also does not touch America very nearly, and therefore cannot be a principal cause of the crisis.
This brings us to the necessity for yet another gen- eralization of the theory of space and time, because the direct interpretation of spatial and temporal co- ordinates by means of measurements obtainable with measuring rods and clocks now breaks down. This can also be expressed as follows : For the physical description of natural processes, neither of the reference bodies K, K1 is unique (lit. " This can be done in a satisfactory manner by making a more subtle stipulation about the measurement or the comparison of lengths. This can be done only in imagination. This can be explained by the example of the problem with which we are now dealing.
This can be interpreted in regard to our present knowledge only in the sense of Doppler's principle, as an expansive motion of the system of stars in the large N as required, according to Friedman, by the field equations of gravitation. This can be made clear by an ex- ample similar to the one given for a light wave. This can be made clear by the following somewhat clumsy-sounding reasoning. This can be obtained without caprice, however, by taking into consideration the following demands: (a) The required generalisation must likewise satisfy the generalpostulate of relativity.
This can be represented graphically in the following way : -f* A final theoretical assumption is necessary: There are two kinds of bodies, those in which the fluids can move freely, called conductors, and those in which they cannot, called insulators. This can be seen easily when we 96 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY regard the whole measurement-process from the system K and remember that the rod placed on the periphery suffers a Loreuz-contraction, not however when the rod is placed along the radius. This can be shown in the following way. This can be so only if the average spatial density of the matter in universal space, concentrated in the stars, vanishes, i.e. This can nevei' be the ca^e ; so that g can never chan^(?
This can only be satisfied for arbitrary va.Ines of B'O'T if the bracket vanishes. This case, according to Gamow, is a simplified model of radio? This caused, to a great extent, the breakdown of the mechanical point of view. This causes a circular movement of the kind illustrated in the diagram. This ceased to exist the moment the current was interrupted. This certainty made things easier. This change in the con- ception of reality is the most profound and fruitful one that has come to physics since Newton; but it has at the same time to be admitted that the program has by no means been completely carried out yet. This change in the number of lines of force is the only essential concept for both the qualitative and the quantitative descrip- tions of the induced current.
This change led to a dualism in the sphere of fundamental concepts which was in the long run intolerable. This circumstance leads us to a second objection which must be raised against the apparently obvious consideration of Section 6. This circumstance, however, does not in the least diminish the conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour of the theory of relativity, for the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, on which the original theory was based, in no way opposes the theory of relativity. This clock C is to be considered at rest at one point of the coordi? This coercion had such a deterring effect (upon me) that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year.
This comes out clearer when instead of (57) we write it in the Form of (47). This comes to requiring that :- The general laws of nature are to be expressed by equations which hold good for all systems of co-ordinates, that is, are co-variant with respect to any substitautions whatever (generall y co-variant ). This competitive spirit prevails even in school and, de? This component was iirst introduced bv Poincare in 1906. This concept of a wave proved very successful in physics. This concept presupposes that of the length of a linear element, that is %o say, a metric. This concept was first introduced by Descartes, when he described the point-in-space by its co-ordinates.
This conception implies one requirement above all that every individuai should have the opportunity to develop the gif ts which may be latent in him. This conception is feasible, because to us the experience of the existence of a lield of force (namely the gravitation field) has shown that it possesses the remarkable property of imparting the same acceleration to all bodies. This conception is logically unexceptionable, and has led to important successes. This conception is sufficiently obvious to ensure that differences of opinion are scarcely likely to arise as to its applicability in practice. This conception must also appear to the reader to be lying at the basis of the second consideration of the last para- graph and imparting a sense to these conceptions.
This conception of the ether to which Machs approach leads, differs in important respects from that of Newton, Fresnel and Lorentz. This conception of time and space is continually present in the mind of the physicist, though often in an unconsci- ous way, as is clearly recognised from the role which this conception has played in physical measurements. This conception suggests itself the more readily as, according to Lorentzs theory, electromagnetic radiation, like ponderable matter, brings impulse and energy with it, and as, according to the special theory of relativity, both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy, ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy.
This conclusion could not have been foreseen, and is based on observation, not reason. This conclusion is reached only by thinking of an idealized experiment, which can never be actually performed, since it is impossible to eliminate all external influences. This condition is satisfied only by linear transformations, that is, transformations of the type x' = a +b ? This condition of general covarianee which takes away the last remnants of physical objectivity from space and time, is a natural requirement, as seen from the following considerations. This condition of things I call apparent over-production. This consequence is another test for the theory. This consideration could very well deter. This consists in the combination of outer multiplication with reduction.
This consists of three plane surfaces perpendicular to each other and rigidly attached to a rigid body. This constitutes the actual physical universe. This continual bombardment by a great number of particles keeps the piston at a certain height by opposing the force of gravity acting downward on the piston and the weights. This contradiction was chiefly eliminated by the pioneering work of H. A. Lorentz in 1895. This convinced me that within the frame of the special theory of relativity there is no room for a satisfactory theory of gravitation. This correction presumes (postulates ) that the velocity of light is constant. This countrv has made only a conditional proposal, and on conditions"' which the Soviet Union is now determined not to accept.
This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism. This curse, along with great social blessings, started with the French Revolution, and before long dragged all the other nations in its train. This dawned upon me only gradually after years of independent scientific work. This decrease in velocity is caused by the same force as the acceleration of a falling body. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy, has been confirmed for all the planets save one, with the precision that is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of observation attainable at the present time. This defect of the theory could only be eliminated by such a formulation of mechanics as would command validity for all Bo.
This definition of the change in velocity may, at first sight, seem artificial and meaningless. This definition reduces the concept of simultaneity of spatially distant events to that of the simultaneity of events happening at the same piace ( coincidence ) , namely the ar? This denationalization can be prepared through a steadily increasing interchange of military and scientifc? This depends upon the fact that the right-hand side of (29) might be multiplied by a factor?, which may depend on v. But the principle of relativity does not permit this factor to be different from 1, as we shall now show.
This derivation displays the relationship between Maxwell's curve and the chromatic distribution curve and deserves attention not only because of its simplicity, but especially because it seems to throw some light on the mechanism of emission and absorption of radiation by matter, a process which is still obscure to us. This determination, however, gives a result which depends upon which of the determining magnitudes specifying the condition of A has been measured (for instance coordinates or momenta ) . This deviation was known before general relativity but had no explanation; general relativity provided it. This did not fit in with the old experimental fact that all bodies have the same acceleration in a gravi- tational field. This difference is unimportant.
This differentiation between speed and velocity illustrates how physics, starting with a concept used in everyday life, changes it in a way which proves fruitful in the further development of science. This difficulty can easily be avoided. This difficulty is got over by the use of divided measuring-rods, the introduction of which does not demand any fundamentally new method. This difficulty was splendidly clarified by the kinetic theory of matter. This difficulty was stressed even more by an experi- ment performed with great skill by Rowland nearly sixty years ago. This diffieultv has been overcome bv Minkowski in a verv elegant manner which w^ill become clear later on.
This diffusion can, on the other hand, also be con- sidered as the result of the random displacement N unknown in magnitude originally N of the suspended particles due to thermal agitation. This diminished simplicity would be due to the fact that the carriage K would be in motion (i.e. This discovery became the basis of al! This discovery taught us that intuitive conclusions based on immediate observation are not always to be trusted, for they sometimes lead to the wrong clues. This distance is the difference in the co-ordinates of the two points. This does not prove that there is no such thing as an ether but certainly does render the ether entirely super- fluous. This drcumstance, which from the empirica! This dualism remains even today, disturbing as it must be to every orderly mind.
This dualism still confronts us in unextenuated form in the theory of Hertz, where matter appears not only as the bearer of velocities, kinetic energy, and mechanical pressures, but also as the bearer of electromagnetic fields. This edition was prepared by John Walker. This effect can be explained by means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of hypotheses which have little probability, and which were devised solely for this purponse. This enables it to organise and sway the emotions of the masses, and make its tool of them. This end can best be attained by the colonization of Palestine, a work in which world Jewry is united, and by the fostering of the Jewish spiritual tradition.
This enunciation comprises four equations for the com- ponents in the four directions, of which the fourth can be deduced from the first three, because both of the above- mentioned vectors are perpendicular to the velocity-vector. This equation expresses the law of aberration in its most general form. This equation expresses the law of conservation of momentum and of energy for the gravitational field. This equation expresses the laws of conservation of impulse and energy in a gravitation-held. This equation shows that the entropy of a monochromatic radiation of sufficiently low density varies with the volume in the same manner as the entropy of an ideal gas or a dilute solution. This essay appeared in Mein Weltbild, Am? This example will enable us to understand the re- fraction of a wave.
This experience, which alone enables us to make inferences about reality, in physics takes the form of experiment and measurement. This experiment begins just in the same way as the previous one. This experiment is interesting, in the first place, be- cause it shows a relation between two apparently quite different phenomena, magnetism and electric current. This experiment was performed about a hundred and fifty years ago by Rumford, and dealt a death blow to the substance theory of heat. This explains how it happens that, in a certain sense, man can influence his life through his own conduct, and that in this process conscious thinking and wanting can play a part.
This explains how it happens that, in a certain sense, man can influence his life through his own conduct, and that in this process conscious thinking and wanting can play a part.Man acquires at birth, through heredity, a biological constitution which we must consider fixed and unalterable, including the natural urges which are characteristic of the human species. This explains why a large portion of all the gold has come to the United States. This explanation was first given by Fitz-Gerald." This exposition has fulfilled its purpose if it shows the reader how the efforts of a life hang together and why they have led to expecta- tions of a definite form. This expresses the temperature dependence of the radiation density according to Planck's law.
This expression for the kinetic energy must also, by virtue of the argument stated above, apply to ponderable masses as well. This expression is only a matter of convention and is at this point quite arbitrary. This extra-logical problem is the essential problem, which the archaeologist will only be able to solve intuitively, by examining his experience and seeing if he can discover anything which corresponds to those pri- mary terms of the theory and the axioms laid down for them. This fact has always roused my respectful admira- tion, and I should like therefore to dwell on it for a moment. This fact is chiefly responsible for America's economic superiority over Europe. This fact is chiefly responsible for America's economie superiority over Europe.
This fact retains its significance even in the limiting: ease C=oo, for the axiomatic construction of Newtonian mechanics, as has already been pointed out by T. R. Sehiitz.t * Minkowski Mechanics, appendix, page 65 of paper (2). This famous prediction of Einstein about the deflection of a beam of light by the sun's gravitational field was tested during the total solar eclipse of May, 1919. This feeling also drove him to pro? This feeling also drove him to produce a text-book of physics, the fruit of many years of strenuous work, of which a medical student said to me the other day: "I don't know how I should ever have got a clear idea of the principles of modern physics in the time at my disposal without this book."
This feeling is the guiding principle of his life and work, in so far as he succeeds in keeping himself from the shackles of selfish desire. This feeling mercifully mitigates the sense of responsibility which so easily becomes paralysing, and it prevents us from taking ourselves and other people too seriously; it conduces to a view of life in which humour, above all, has its due place. This field equation, with r.. sufficiently small, is in any case also compatible with the facts of experience derived from the solar system. This field is generated by atomistic electric charges upon which the Jield in turn exerts ponderomotive forces. This field representation, as we shall call it, may appear clear and interesting, but there is no reason to believe that it marks any real ad- vance.
This first step is necessary to make any successive moves possible. This follows from the simple mechanical transformation principles. This force can, for example, be measured by means of a spring-balance which is at rest in this last system. This force consists in the action only; and remains no longer in the body, when the action is over. This force is less near the bottom, where the speed of the cur- rent is reduced by friction, than higher above the bottom. This force would bring the molecule to rest, if it were not for the irregularity of the radiative interactions which transmit a momentum A of changing sign and magnitude to the molecule during time r; such an unsystematic effect, as opposed to that previously mentioned, will sustain some movement of the molecule.
This force, if caused by a circulating charge, depended, as shown by Rowland's experiment, on the velocity of the charge. This formed the pattern for our mechanical view. This formula gives immediately (1/T) = ? This formula gives us one of the best methods for finding out a very fundamental number in physicsnamelythe number of molecules in one gm. This formulation permits the treatment of the problem of the planets. This four-dimensional " world " bears a close similarity to the three-dimensional " space " of (Euclidean) analytical geometry. This frame, to which we refer all our observations, constructed of rigid un- changeable bodies, is called the co-ordinate system. This freedom of communication is indispen?

This friendly service far our predecessors must indeed not be neglected, particularly as such a memory of the best of the past is proper to stimulate the well-disposed of today to a courageous effort. This gave one freedom in the choice of pursuits until a few months before the examination, a freedom which I enjoyed to a great extent and have gladly taken into the bargain the bad conscience con- nected with it as by far the lesser evil. This general notion of the antagonism of the tissues, especially of epithelium and connective tissue, was the subject to which he devoted his scientific energies, especially in the last ten years of his life. This gives a satisfactory explanation of Blondlot's negative results.
This gives the equation leaves an additive constant free, we may so choose the Iatter that E = Mc2 Mv + E v = M'v c2 or Public Affairs. This gives the variations in the radiation pressure for that frequency band. This goal is perfectly within our reach, because our work of construction has been, and must continue to be, carried out in such a manner as to serve the real interests of the Arab population also. This govemment must be based on a clearcut constitution which is approved by the govemments and the nations and which gives it the sole dis?

This great result is due to the field theory.
This group replaces the group of the Lorentz-transformations of the spe- cial theory of relativity, which forms a sub-group of the former. This had, to begin with, to be introduced into the theory as an entity independent of gravitation. This happens after the first second. This has been my fate, and the contrast between the popular estimate of my powers and achievements and the reality is simply grotesque. This has been proved directly only for an electromagnetic field, although we may claim universal validity for it. This has been the declared aim of all those who have been honoured as moral and spiritual leaders beyond the limits of their own time and country without exception, from Jesus Christ to Goethe and Kant.
This has come as a bitter and grievous disappointment to us, which would no doubt have led inevitably to a parting of the ways even if we had not received your resignation. This hasty consideration suggests that a general theory of relativity must supply the laws of gravita- tion, and the consistent following up of the idea has justified our hopes. This holds for the propagation of light in vacuo in a higher degree than for any other process which could be considered, thanks to the investigations of Maxwell and H. A. Lorentz. This hope has been realised in the most beautiful manner. This hyperbola may be called the " hyperbola of curvature " at P (^vide fig.
This hypothesis, to be sure, did not at first bring with it any advance in the theory of gravitation or in physics generally, so that it became customary to treat Newtons law of force as an axiom not further reducible. This idea remains in ancient philosophy nothing more than an ingenious figment of the imagination. This ii enclosed in a glass jar or flask and the metal is in contact only with non-metallic bodies, called in- sulators.

This in itself enables the reader to draw the inevitable condusions." This in itself is already sufficient to consti.tute a serious menace to the intellectual freedom of the nation. This in itself is not measurable. This in itself is sufficient to exclude the possibility of the exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our universe.
This in itself would be sat- isfactory, if we did not know from quantum phenomena that Maxwell's theory does not do justice to the energetic properties of radiation. This in itself would give rise to no change in the flow of the liquid if the latter rotated like a solid body. This in my opinion is true in a certain sense even for tech? This in my opinion is true in a certain sense even for technical schools, whose students will devote them? This in particular is the case for the concepts of motion, space, time.
This in t)rinciple eom])letely solves the problem of motion ; for the four GENERALLSEi) THEORY 0 RELATIVITY 149 equations (57a) together with the i^iveii e([uatioii between jj and p, and the equation (If (li'n ^ P _ 1 are sufficient, with the given values of g n, for finding out the six unknowns dx^ d>\ (Ix ^ dx^ ^ ^ ^'*' ds ' dn ' c^.s" ' ds If ^ ^s are unknown we have also to take the equ- tions (53). This includes the case where man himself is the subject. This incomplete suggestion will suffice for the present purpose. This indehniteness is due to the wide freedom in the choice of co-ordinates, so that mathematically the [)roblern is indelinite in the sense that three of the S[)ace-functions can be arbitrarily chosen.
This indicates that any attempt logically to derive the basic concepts and laws of mechanics from the ultimate data of experience is doomed to failure. This inevitably led to the theory of the quasi-rigid lumi- niferous ether, whose parts are incapable of any motion with respect to each other beyond the small deformations which correspond to the waves of light. This influence, however, should not be overesti? This insight led him to a sceptical attitude as concerns knowledge of any kind. This insight led him to a skeptical attitude as concerns knowledge of any kind. This intellectual achievement commands our admiration all the more for having preceded Fara- days and Clerk Maxwells field theory of electricity.
This international association, whose members would need to keep in touch with each other by a constant interchange of opinions, might, by defining its attitude in the Press responsibility always resting with the signatories on any given occasion acquire a considerable and salutary moral influence over the settlement of political questions. This introduction ad hoc of the concept of absolute space, while logically unexcep- tionable, nevertheless seems unsatisfactory. This invariant ds may be expressed in arbitrary co-ordinates. This involves using the principle of relativity, which says that the laws of nature do not alter their form when one proceeds from the orig- inal (legitimate) system of co-ordinates to a new one which is in uniform translatory motion with respect to it.
This inward freedom is an infrequent gif t of nature and a worthy objective for the individual. This inward freedom is an infrequent gift of nature and a worthy objective for the individua!. This is Dopplers principle for any velocities whatever. This is a consequence of the theory and can be easily con- firmed by experiment. This is a definite mathematical condition that the theory of relativity demands of a natural law, and in virtue of this, the theory becomes a valuable heuristic aid in the search for general laws of nature.
This is a fact with which we have to reckon ; law and might inevitably go hand in hand, and juridical decisions approach more nearly the ideal justice demanded by the com- munity (in whose name and interests these verdicts are pronounced) in so far as the community has effective power to compel respect of its juridical ideal. This is a generalisation of the extension of the four- vector. This is a hypothesis as to the physical nature of tbe continuum under consideration, and at the same time a convention as to the choice of co-ordinates. This is a lack of exactness which seems harmless only since with the help of light ( whose velocity is practically infinite from the point of view of daily experience ) the simultaneity of spatially distant events can apparently be decided immediately.
This is a movement to aid not individuals, but an entire nation. This is a quantitative question and a more or less quantitative theory must be built up to answer it. This is a question to which I feel compelled, not merely by my spontaneous feelings but on rational grounds, to return an unqualified "yes." This is a restricting principle for natural laws, compar- able to the restricting principle of the non-existence of the perpetuum mobile which underlies thermody- namics. This is all; everything beyond this follows from the development of appropriate mathemati- cal methods by means of deduction. This is allowed because the exponential function varies slowly with ?. This is already a theoretical interpretation of the observable evidence, an interpretation which is, in fact, arbitrary.
This is also analogous to the training of . This is also analogous to the training of the mind and the exercising of the mental and manual skill. This is also the case for a sum of four such terms : when j/^^^), <^(i)...i^(4) ^(4) are scalars. This is also the case, according to the generai theory of relativity, for a part of four-di? This is also undoubtedly in the ON FREEDOM 31 interests of the Italian state and its prestige in the eyes of the world. This is also undoubtedly in the interests of the Italian State and its prestige in the eyes of the world. This is always accompanied by a chang- ing magnetic field. This is an incontestable positicin, which is taken up at the present time by de Bitter.
This is an interesting example of the fact that even scholars of auda- cious spirit and fine instinct can be obstructed in the interpretation of facts by philosophical prejudices. This is another problem tackled by modern physics, but still far from a complete and satisfactory solution. This is by no means true for all gravitational fields, but only for those of quite special form. This is certainly a very paradoxical conclusion ! This is certainly not a very practical way of determining the ratio of two masses. This is clear from tbe part wbich these concepts play in pbysical measurements ; it must also bave underlain the reader's re:fl.exions on tbe preceding paragraph ( 2) for him to connect any meaning with what be there read.
This is clear if we think about some simple experiments which marked the beginning of civilization. This is connected with the fact that the velocity c plays a fundamental role in this theory. This is done in order to fix the c.s. This is done in such a way, that only one meaning can be attached to the assignment, and that numbers (Gaussian coordinates) which differ by an indefinitely small amount are assigned to adjacent points. This is due to the fact that the determinant g of the g vanishes for xy =0. This is due to the fact that the intelli? This is due to the fact that the intelligence and the character of the masses are incompa? This is easily understood from the primary law of the motion. This is empty space without electromagnetic :6.eld and without matter.
This is equally true under all circumstances, whether the erosion depends on mechanical or on physico-chemical factors (decomposition of the ground). This is essentially the point of view adopted by Minkowski. This is exactly what happens in Euclids geometry, except that there the fundamental laws are called axioms and there is no question of the conclusions having to correspond to any sort of experience. This is expressed by V = ooodx dx dx1 2 3 By means of Jacobi's theorem we may write V = ooodx dx'1 '2 dx'2 = ? This is expressed by the sentence: Our space is a three-dimensional continuum. This is gravely detrimental to the formal beauty of the theory.
This is hard to make clear to those who do not experience it, since it does not involve an anthropomorphic idea of God; the individual feels the vanity of human desires and aims, and the nobility and marvelous order which are revealed in nature and in the world of thought. This is held to be the case, for example, in the propositions of geome? This is held to be the case, for example, in the propositions of geometry and in the principle of causality. This is his velocity relative to the ship, or, in other words, relative to a c.s. This is indeed a simple matter. This is intelligible without calculation but only for the two-dimensional case if we revert once more to the case of the disc on the surface of the sphere.
This is more or less expressed by saying that the four-dimensional space (with imaginary time-co- ordinates) of the special theory of relativity possesses a Euclidean metric. This is my position in a nutshell: Mere agreements to limit armaments furnish no sort of security. This is no doubt the meaning of his saying, hypotheses non jingo. This is no longer of any practical use, but it still furnishes a very simple example of a source of current in school demonstrations and in textbook descriptions. This is not a matter of charity, but an enterprise which concerns all Jews and the success of which promises to be a source of the highest satisfaction to all. This is not so easily noticed only be?
This is not so easily noticed only because we have the habit of combining certain concepts and conceptual relations (propositions) so definitely with certain sense-experiences that we do not become conscious of the gulf-logically unbridgeable which separates the world of sensory experiences from the world of concepts and propositions. This is not so for a scientist. This is not the case, for the following reason. This is of moment not merely for the destiny of the Jews, whose welfare depends on their sticking together and helping each other, but, over and above that, for the cultivation of the international spirit, which is in danger everywhere to-day from a narrow-minded nationalism. This is one of the steps which lead to the genera!
This is particularly true of our concepts of time and space, which physicists have been obliged by the facts to bring down from the Olympus of the a priori in order to adjust them and put them in a serviceable condition. This is possible only in combination with the guarantee of all for the security of each separate nation, based on a permanent court of arbitration independent of governments. This is probably the reason why among contemporary theoretical physicists there exist en- tirely differing opinions concerning the question as to how the theoreti- cal foundation of the physics of the future will appear.
This is readily understood if we envisage the whole process of measuring from the " stationary " system K, and take into consideration tbat the measuring-rod applied to tbe peripbery undergoes a Lorentzian contraction, while tbe one applied alon g the radius does not. This is really exactly analogous to Euclidean geometry, except that in the latter the basic laws are called 'axioms';and, further,that in this field thereis no questionof the consequenceshaving to correspond with any experiences. This is received by A two seconds after he had sent his own. This is required by the condition g = - 1. This is rigorously a quantitative question, but the fact that a given quantity of mechanical energy can be changed into a definite amount of heat is highly important.
This is satisfactory to the pure mathematician. This is shown by a well-known experiment: we have three vessels con- taining, respectively, cold, warm and hot water. This is shown by the fourth equation of the Lorentz transformation: Moreover, according to this equation the time difference _t1 of two events with respect to K1 does not in general vanish, even when the time difference _t1 of the same events with reference to K vanishes. This is shown clearly in the drawing. This is suggested by the fact that here, as in electrostatic phenomena, we have attraction and repulsion.
This is the God of Providence who protects, disposes, rewards, and punishes, the God who, according to the width of the believer's outlook, loves and cherishes the life of the tribe or of the human race, or even life as such, the comforter in sorrow and unsatisfied longing, who preserves the souls of the dead. This is the God of Providence, who protects, decides, rewards, and punishes. This is the God of Providence, who protects, disposes, rewards, and punishes; the God who, accord? This is the God who, according to man's widening horizon, loves and provides for the life of the race, or of mankind, or who even loves life itself. This is the basis for the construction, respectively definition of all other statements and concepts. This is the basis of all measurement of length.
This is the basis on whicb H. A. Lorentz obtained his syn? This is the case, for example, with the coordinate of the particle. This is the difficult problem which the Ort Society is success fully tackling. This is the elementary law found out by A. Lienard, and E. This is the elementary law found out by A. Lienard, and E. This is the elementary law found out by A. Lienard, and E. This is the equation of continuity, which differs from that of x d? This is the equation of continuity, which differs from that of x d? This is the equation of motion of the materia! This is the expression for the extension of a contravariant tensor of the second rank, and corresponding expressions for the extension of contravariant tensors of higher and lower rank may also be formed.
This is the grave problem which the O.R.T. This is the initial clue to the problem of motion, but it certainly does not suffice for a thorough explanation of all mo- tions observed. This is the kind of position in which theory finds itself at present in regard to the laws of heat, radia- tion, and molecular movement at low temperatures. This is the law of blackbody radiation. This is the only theory at present which permits a unitary grasp of experiences con- cerning the quantum character of micro-mechanical events. This is the place for a brief presentation of the most important mathematical concepts and operations of this calculus of tensors. This is the problem : Is there any way of delivering mankind from the menace of war ?
This is the process of reduction of the wave packet; the wave packet given by the infinite series (7) is reduced to a single term )t h(xg)uh(x(). This is the programme for the general theory of relativity. This is the reason that the theory of invariants, which has to do with the laws that govern the form of invariants, is so important for analytical geometry. This is the reason why E. Mach was led to make the attempt to eliminate space as an active cause in the system of mechanics. This is the significance of Galileo's discovery. This is the simplest, because there are no external forces acting. This is the social or moral conception of God. This is the social or moral idea of God.
This is the ultimate foundation in fact which enables us to speak with meaning of the mensuration, in Riemann's sense of the word, of the four-dimensional continuum of space-time. This is the ultimate foundation in fact which enables us to speak with meaning of the mensuration, in Riemanns sense of the word, of the fourdimensional continuum of space-time. This is the underlying principle of all natural philosophy. This is the wellknown StokesOs Rule. This is to be answered in the negative ; the above-named behaviour of the freely moving masses relative to K' esu} be explained in as good a manner in the following way. This is to say, the laws according to which fixed bodies may be arranged in space, do not com- pletely accord with the spatial laws attributed to bodies by Euclidean geometry.
This is true not only for the theories of electric fluids and field, but for all changes in physical theories, however revolutionary they may seem. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by politi? This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. This is true, for example, of life within cities and, to a certain degree, even of society within individuai states. This is very powerful argument in favour of the principle of relativity. This is what I have in mind when I reco=end the "humanities" as important, not just dry specialized knowledge in the fields of history and philosophy.
This is what gave her that severe outward aspect, so easily mjsinterpreted by those who were not dose to her-a curi? This is what is meant by the phrase, "a warp in space." This is what the painter, the poet, the speculative philosopher and the natural scientist do, each in his own fashion. This is what we have to prevent. This is what we mean by the search for a foundation of the whole of physics. This is what we mean when we attribute to the bodily object "a real existence." This is what we mean when we attribute to the bodily them a concept - the concept of the bod self knows best, and feels more surely ily object. This is what we mean when we talk of the curvature of space.
This is why foreign countries are not able to pay for the export commodities of the United States, payment which, in the long run, would indeed be possible only through imports by the latter. This is why we do not feel at all that it is meaningless to ask such questions as: "Why should we not lie?" This is, in fact , a coil of wire as shown in the drawing. This is, in fact, not an arbitrary assumption. This is, in principle, the same experi- ment as Oersted's, the only difference being that instead of an ordinary current we have a mechanically effected motion of the electric charge. This is, in principle, the way mechanics predicts the course of a body in motion, but the method used here is hardly practical.
This is, of course, merely a statement of what is meant by the absence of an interaction between the two systems. This is, to be sure, a more diffi? This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incom? This kind of order leads to the menta!conception of a subjective time, an ordinating scheme for our experience. This last restriction is, however, eliminated if one replaces the differential equations Ri7' = O by g2Ri1' = O, the left hand sides of which are whole rational functions of the gik and of their derivatives. This last time {i.e., common time) can be defined, if we establish by definition that the time which Hght requires in travelling from A to B is equivalent to the time which light requires in travelling from B to A.
This last vector is seen to be directed along the string toward the centre of the circle, and is always perpendicular to the velocity vector, or tangent. This latter proposition I take to be entirely true; but I hold the prescription for thinking which is grounded on this proposition to be false. This latter proposition I take to be eutirely true; but I hold the prescrip? This latter proposition also holds good even if only the more special assertion is correct, that with any choice of the four-vector B" the inner prod uct Av B"B" is a scalar, if in addition it is known that A,uv satisfies the condition of symmetry Av = Av. This law can easily be generalized in the case of CO-variant and contravariant tensors of any rank.
This law correspondingly holds for tensors of any rank and character. This law is a system of total di:fferential equations, the system characteristic of the geodetic line. This law is not yet the general law of the gravitational field, since the gravitational field under consideration is of a special kind. This law is valid only for small velocities. This law not only says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also indicates the reference-bodies or systems of coordinates, permissible in mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. This law of the inverse ratio of the pressure to the velocity obviously makes it possible to determine the force of pressure produced by the motion of a liquid (or gas), simply by knowing the distribution of velocities in the liquid.
This law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form in the light of the following consideration. This law, which may also be formu- lated as the law of the equality of inertial and gravi- tational mass, was now brought home to me in all its significance. This leads to Einstein's famous Principle of Equivalence. This leads to a fall in sales and profits. This leads to the notion of "change of relative position'' of the two objects; and, in this way, also to the notion of "relative position" of the two objects. This leads to the result that the Lorentz transformation-applied to space and time coordinates-must govern the transition from one inertial system to any other. This leads us to transpose the statistica! This letter need not be considered "confidential."
This limitation is, of course, only a property of the human eye. This line of argument imposes itself with considerably enhanced force in relation to the general theory of relativity, since, according to that theory, the physical properties of space are affected by pon- derable matter. This local character of the c.s. This lucidity and certainty made an indescribable impression upon me. This m4y perhaps apply to motor-cars and wheat in the United States at the present moment, although even that is doubtful. This makes it possible to blame the failure on the Russians. This makes the reality of P and Q depend upon the process of measurement carried out on the first system, which does, not disturb the second system in any way.
This makes us realize to what extent tbe same language means the same mentality. This makes us realize to what extent the same language means the same mentality. This marvellous accomplishment of reason gave to the human spirit the confidence it needed for its future achievements. This may appear at first sight to be a violation of the principle of constancy of light-velocity. This may be done, but then the speed of the actions along the lines of force must be assumed as infinitely great ! This may be illustrated by a few examples. This may be represented approximately as uniform circular mo- tion. This may be seen most easily from tbe consider? This may be shown in the following manner.
This may perhaps apply to motor cars and wheat in the United States at the present moment, although even THOUGHTS ON THE WORLD ECONO:MIC CRISIS 89 that is doubtful. This means an intervention on the part of reli? This means an ntervention on the part of religion into the sphere of science; this is where the struggle of the Church aganst the doctrines of Galileo and Danvin belongs. This means that for finite regions of space the ex- istence (significant for physics) of a general Rie- mannian metric is presupposed according to the formula % ds2 = dx^ dx*' , flV whereby the summation is to be extended to all index combinations from 1 1 to 44. This means that of all the many colours we allow only one to pass through the slit, the others being stopped by a screen.
This means that the 'l J function does not determine, at any rate exactly, the story of the qr as functions of the time t. According to Boro, however, an interpretation of the physical meaning of the 'l J functions was shown to be possible in the following manner: 'l!J'l!J ( the square of the absoIute value of the complex function 'l!J ) is the probability density at the point under consideration in the cofiguration-space .of the qr, at the time t. It is therefore poss1ble to charactenze the content of the Schrodinger equation in a manner, easy to be understood, but not quite accurate, as follows: it determines how the probability density of a statistica!ensemble of sys?
This means that the Euclidean geometry holds good in the infinitesi- mal neighborhood of every point P. Thus for the neighborhood of every point P there is a local Car- tesian system of co-ordinates, in reference to which the metric is calculated according to the Pythagorean theorem. This means that the force by which the earth attracts different masses must be different. This means that the rhythm of a moving clock and the length of a moving stick depend on the speed. This means that the rule ..Thou shalt not lie" has been traced back to the demands: "Human lif e shall be preserved" and '1'ain and sorrow shall be lessened as much as possible." This means that the time is no longer an invariant. This means that we assume the existence of a sea of ether with all c.s.
This means that we displace all the points of the one crystal except those on the axis. This means that you want to describe all positions with respect to the rigid walls of the room. This means, briefly, that both gases have the same volume, temperature, and pressure. This means: they concern not one single system but an aggregation of identical systems; they cannot be verified by measurement of one individual, but only by a series of repeated measurements. This mechanics is characterized by the fiction that the density of matter and speed of matter is dependent in a con? This message published in Mein Weltbild, Amsterd am: Querid o Verlag, 1934. This message was published in Mein Weltbild, Amsterdam: Querid o Verlag, 1934.
This method dispenses with any exact know- ledge of initial states. This method led to the discovery of the necessary connection between impulse and energy, the strength of an electric and a magnetic field, electrostatic and electro-dynamic forces, inert mass and energy; and the number of independent concepts and funda- mental equations was thereby reduced. This method pointed beyond itself. This modification correspond s perfectly to the tn,nsi? This momentum can be assumed of different sign and magnitude in different cases. This more aristocratic illusion concerning the unlimited penetrative power of thought has as its counterpart the more plebeian illusion of na!ve realism, according to which things "are" as they are perceived by us through our senses.
This more general theory does not contradict the classical transformation and classical mechanics. This motion is the result of one wave lying on the other when the two are travelling in opposite directions. This motion then coincids with the motion which is required by the equations of classical mechanics. This must be changed, if only in America's own interest. This must be changed, if only in the essential interests of the Americans. This must be kept in mind when we seek to understand spiritual or intellectual movements and the way in which they develop. This must be so, if there is a mean density of the ponderable matter in universal space differing from zero.
This must evidently be identical with the velocity distribution of the molecules which is entirely due to their collisions among themselves, i.e. This naive view can be made more useful by quantitative considerations. This new "framework" may of course have all kinds of very complicated movements when referred to the old Galilean or *' rectangular unaccelerated system of co-ordinates." This new "secondary system" damental relations which themselves pays for its higher logical unity by having can be chosen freely (axioms). This new "secondary system" pays for its higher logical unity by having, as its own elementary concepts ( concepts of the second layer ), only those which are no longer directly connected with complexes of sense experiences.
This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable, though much less certain, that extremely powerful- ful bombs of new type may thus be constructed. This new theory is mainly a theory of gravitation and has very little connection with optics and electricity. This new view proved very successful and fruitful in the further development of physics. This newly introduced centrifugal force is usually looked upon as a mathematical fictionas '' geometrical" rather than physical. This non-rigid reference-body, which might appropriately be termed a "reference-mollusc", is in the main equivalent to a Gaussian four-dimensional coordinate system chosen arbitrarily. This not being the case, we are left with the alter- natives stated.
This notation is more natural than the usual one, because, in contrast to the latter, it is applicable to Cartesian left-handed systems as well as to right-handed systems without change of sign. This notion is logically un- objectionable and has important successes to its credit. This number can only be an integer and can change only by jumps. This numerical example shows that the counting of the states must have gone awry, if the resonator's energy can only assume the value zero or 6.5 x 107 times its average energy (or a multiple thereof). This objective will dominate more and more our entire public lif e and will poison our youth long before the catastrophe is itself actually upon us. This observation presents another grave complication.
This observer should be supplied with an arrangement (e.g. This obviously implies a complete failure to account for all those optical experiments which depend for their satisfactory explanation on the assumption of a value for the convection coefficient equal to 1 V/*^' The modifications proposed independently by Hertz and Heaviside fare no better. This oc- cupation was, on the whole, truly , fascinating; climaxes were reached whose impression could easily com- pete with that of elementary geo- metryNthe basic idea of analytical geometry, the infinite series, the concepts of differential and integral. This occurred in the kinetic theory of gases and, in a generai way, in statistica! This occurs whenever this religious stock of ideas con?
This operation is a generalization of the extension of a vector. This operation may be aptly characterized as a mixed one, being " outer " with respect to the indices , and r, and " inner " with respect to the indices 11 and <T. This osmotic pressure depends upon the actual magnitude of the molecules, i.e., upon the number of molecules in a gramequivalent. This ought to manifest itself in the following way. This outline may perhaps create the impression that the presently prevailing military powers are to be assigned too dominant a role. This part of the axis of Y is a rod moving perpendicularly to its axis with velocity v relatively to system K. Its ends possess in K the co-ordinates and x2 = vt, y2 = 0, z2 = 0. This path leads to the so-called relativity theory.
This picture, though primitive, seems to fit many of the facts, so that the analogy runs : Water Heat Higher level Higher temperature Lower level Lower temperature The flow proceeds until both levels, that is, both tem- peratures, are equal. This plague-spot of civilization ought to be abolished with all possible speed. This plea was needed in order to make the hearer or reader more ready to follow the ensuing train of ideas with attention ; it is the line of thought which has led from the special to the general theory of relativity and thence to its latest offshoot, the unitary field theory. This point of view, however, we cannot accept at all. This political power-hunger is wont to batten on the activities of another group, whose aspirations are on purely mercen- ary, economic lines.
This position of Mars regularly recurs after one, two, etc., Martian years, as Mars has a self-enclosed orbit. This prediction is a consequence of the substance theory of light, for new colours cannot be created. This preliminary statement may be characterized as follows: ( I) The concept of the materiai point and of its mass is retained. This primitive idea, which probably also lies at the bot- tom of the well-known Kantian problematic concerning the possibility of "synthetic judgments a priori" rests obviously upon the fact that the relation of geometrical concepts to objects of direct experience (rigid rod, finite interval, etc.) This probability is measured by the number of "configurations", a number that counts the number of ways the state under consideration can be realized.
This process was similar to the equalization of temperatures by heat flow. This progress had, indeed, to be paid for by increasing the complexity of tbe forces of interaction wbicb had to be assumed as existing between electrical masses in motion. This property enables us to distinguish an inertial c.s. This proves that knowledge and justice are ranked above wealth and power by a large section of the human race. This proves that the propositions of Euclidean geometry cannot hold exactly on the rotating disc, nor in general in a gravitational field, at least if we attribute the length I to the rod in all positions and in every orientation. This provokes the following question. This qualification has to do with the concept of God. This quantity might be transformed with a factor.
This question brings us to the most important matter, in comparison to which everything else appears insignificant indeed. This question is not easily answered for the reason already mentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of Fizeau. This question leads to a general one. This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a perfectly definite transformation law for the space-time magnitudes of an event when changing over from one body of reference to another. This re- quires that the pressure on its left edge should be stronger than that on its right.
This realization mercifully mitigates the easily paralyzing sense of responsibility and prevents us from taking ourselves and THE WORLD AS I SEE IT 9 other people all tao seriously; it is conducive to a view of life which, in particular, gives humor its due. This relative motion was expected to produce a visible anisotropy of space, i.e., optical phenomena were expected to depend on the orientation of the apparatus. This religion is considerably stabilized though not caused by the formation of a priestly caste which claims to mediate between the people and the being they fear, and so attains a position of power.
This reminds us of the fact that in acoustics, a series of discrete frequency values is coordinated to a linear partial differential equation (if boundary values are given ) namely the sinusoidal periodic solutions. This represents the portion of the space-time manifold in which the electromagnetic field acts upon the body, or upon the electric charges contained in it, the action upon them being transmitted to the body. This requirement implies that the potential energy m..jB becomes infinitely great at infinity. This result admits of an experimental test by means of the photographic registration of stars during a total eclipse of the sun.
This result can be expressed by the so-called Galilean relativity principle : if the laws of mechanics are valid in one c.s., then they are valid in any other c.s. This result is aiso valid from the standpoint of an observer who is rotating with the disc. This result is very im- portant for the understanding of many chemical pheno- mena. This result was interpreted physically by regarding K as at rest with respect to a hypothetical 34ther of space. This revival of our tongue constitutes an important factor in our struggle for independence. This rule applies correspondingly to tensors of any rank and character, and the proof is analogous in all cases. This scalar is the Divergence of the contravariant four- Toctor A , 128 PRINCIPLE OP UELATIVITY ^ notation of the [covariant) fowr^vector.
This science was able, as I have already observed, to get along without the concept of space as such, the ideal corporeal forms point, straight line, plane, length ^being sufficient for its needs. This second and greater part of the evil can be overcome by closer combination and by deliberate education of the minority, whose spiritual liberation can thus be accomplished. This second possibility is also of importance in the quantum theory of radiation. This security and the spare time and energy which the individual will have at his command can be made to further his development. This security and the spare time and energy which tl1e individuai will have at bis disposal can be turned to the development of his personality. This seemed so obvious that it was hardly worth mentioning.
This seems the ob- vious view, but classical mechanics forbid it. This seems to be generally realized. This seems to contradict all our experience. This seems to me a very happy device, for two men or groups of men can usually discuss things together most reasonably, honestly, and dispassionately when there is no third person present in front of whom they think they must be careful what they say. This seems to me connected with the fact called the narrowness of conscious? This seems to me to be the correct theoretical interpretation of Heisenberg's indeterminacy relation. This seems to me to be the permanent upshot of Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty. This sentence at first sight may remind us of one from a language lesson: "I have no pencil, but you have six oranges."
This sentence can, of course, hardly be regarded as an explanation. This shall be shown afterwards. This short ac- count is enough to show how the elements of New- tonian theory passed over into the general theory of relativity, whereby the three defects above mentioned were overcome. This shows clearly that the probability waves are more abstract than the electromagnetic and gravita- tional field existing and spreading in our three-dimen- sional space. This shows that our two fundamental principles are compatible.5 In the equations of transformation which have been developed there enters an unknown function ? This shows us that in comparing different theories of the motion of the electron we must proceed very cautiously.
This signifies that any velocity v = /(dx1) + (dx2 ) + (dx3) 'V d x 4 d x4 dx4 may occur, which is less than the veloci ty of light in vacuo. This signifies, according to what has been said before, a total neglect of the influence of gravitation. This simple ex- planation seems to promise success for the corpuscular theory of light. This simple experimental fact is well known, but its prediction follows logically from the kinetic view of matter. This simple theory, imitating the theory of electricity, is adequate for an explanation of the first experiment. This simply means that the spherical surface of the globe is finite in relation to the paper discs. This situation requires a single judicial and executive power for the entire planet, and the creation of such a centrai au?
This slight sketch indicates how a generalized theory of relativity must include the laws of gravitation, and actual pursuit of the conception has justified the hope. This small group exerts an overwhelming dominati.on over the institutions for the educati.on of our youth as well as over the great newspapers of the country. This socia!sense may be partly due to the English tradition. This social sense may be partly due to the English tradition. This society, through discussion of the inherent problems, will make it easier far tl1e individual to clarify bis mind and arrive at a clear position as to bis own stand; moreover, mutual help is essential far those who face difficulties because they fallow their conscience.
This solution would correspond to the case in which the matter of the fxed stars was dis? This source of feeling able to accord man solace, help; and guidance; also, by virtue of its simplicity it is accessible to the most undeveloped mind. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion. This space was conceived as absolute in another sense also; its inertia-determining effect was conceived as autonomous, i.e., not to be influenced by any physical circumstance whatever ; it affected masses, but noth- ing affected it.
This space-time variability of the reciprocal relations of the standards of space and time, or, perhaps, the recognition of the fact that empty space in its physical relation is neither homogeneous nor isotropic, compelling us to describe its state by ten functions (the gravitation potentials g? This space-vector is connected with the space-vector J = C pti, which we denoted in as the conduction- current. This spark reveals the strong potential differences caused by the rapid change of the magnetic field. This spatial structure stands, in a sense, midway between the Riemannian and the Euclidean.
This spatio-temporal variability of the relations of scales and clocks to each other, or the knowledge that empty space is, physically speaking, neither homogeneous nor isotropic, which compels us to describe its state by means of ten functions, the gravi- tational potentials gixv, has no doubt finally disposed of the notion that space is physically empty. This special kind of matter, bowever, appeared to be lacking in the fundamental property of inertia; and, the forces acting between these masses and tbe ponderable matter remained obscure. This spirit will not stop short of the gates of America I had almost said, has not stopped short. This spontaneous feeling is the ultimate cause of anti-Semitism, which is therefore not to be got rid of by well-meaning propaganda.
This state obviously possesses a different entropy (S), and now wish to evaluate the entropy difference with the help of the Boltzmann Principle. This state of affairs is unworthy of both nations and can only be altered by our finding a via media on which both sides agree. This state of affairs was very unsatisfying. This statement cannot be valid for arbitrary moving systems of coordinates. This statement is pure convention, for it is the application of the ter- minology created by the theory to the description of the process of rubbing. This statement makes sense only if the position of the axis about which the rotation takes place is fixed. This statement may seem to be designed to drive my audience away without more ado.
This statement should be true regardless of the care with which we verify it. This statement we shall call the "principle of special relativity." This stationary ether, as shown by Young, also afforded a satisfactory explanation of astronomical aberration. This stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis, the validity of which will hardly be doubted without empirical evidence to the contrary. This strange phe- nomenon was necessarily connected, on grounds of geometry, with the rotation of the cannon balls, as there could be no other conceivable reason for a lateral asymmetry in the resistance of the air.
This study, based on the assumption that heat is an indestructible substance which :Hows from a wanner to a colder object, seemed to give us a principle of the "conserva- - tion of heat.'' This supreme good has been paid for by the martyr's blood of pure and great men, for whose sake Italy is still loved and reverenced to-day. This system (HO) contains essentially four equatioDs, which can be thus written : (GOa) < 6F^3 a. This system corresponds to the second of Maxwell's systems of equations. This system of n^ components completely describes the structure of space. This system of reference is by no means uniquely deter- mined by the phenomena. This system will be completely defined according to the theory under discussion by the variables of condition pl .
This system, which, for example, can be an ideal gas or a dilute solution, possesses an entropy S0. This tendency of charge to escape from a conductor is a direct measure of its potentials/In order to show clearly the difference between charge and potential we shall formulate a few sentences describing the behaviour of heated bodies, and the corresponding sentences concerning charged conductors. This term will also be present in the case of a viscous fluid. This theory has been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish it from the extended theory, with which we shall deal later. This theory has led to a determination of the elementary quanta, which has been splendidly confirmed by the most recent measurements on alpha-particles.
This theory has not yet caught the popular imagination to the same extent as the new theory of Time, and Space, but it is none the less iconoclastic in its scope as far as classical concepts are concerned. This theory has received impressive confirma- tion from experience and has led to a simplification of the theoretical description of groups of facts already connected together. This theory is more than a play of the imagination. This theory is still based directly on an empirical law, that of the constant velocity of light. This theory made it clear that mass is not a constant quantity but depends on (indeed it is equivalent to) the amount qf energy content.
This theory replaces mechanical quantities (the deformation and velocity of the ether's parts) with the electromagnetic state of the ether and the material under consideration. This theory therefore satisfies the conditions of the special theory of relativity, but when viewed from the latter it acquires a novel aspect. This theory was of a purely electrodynamical nature, and was obtained by the use of particular hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter. This theory, also called the theory of the stationary luminiferous ether, derived strong support from the experiments, of fundamental importance for the special theory of relativity too, of Fizeau, which proved conclusively that the luminiferous ether does not participate in the motions of bodies.
This theory, on the one hand, and the theory of relativity on the other, are both con- sidered correct in a certain sense, al- though their combination has resisted all efforts up to now. This theoryalso called the theory of the stationary luminiferous ethermoreover found a strong support in an experiment which is also of fundamental importance in the special theory of relativity, the experiment of Fizeau, from which one was obliged to infer that the luminiferous ether does not take part in the movements of bodies. This threw some light on the fact that in their gaseous state elements and their com? This time we do not bring the rubbed rod into actual contact with the metal, but only near it. This topic brings me to that worst outcrop of berd life, the military system, which I abbor.
This topic brings me to that worst outcrop of the herd nature, the military system, which I abhor. This transformation is homogeneous and of the first degree in the a?. This type of wave is called longitudinal. This union made possible such precision in the formulation of natural laws and such certainty in checking them by experience that as a result there was no longer room for basic differences of opinion in natural science. This unity was furtber strengtbened by tbe general use of tbe Latin language. This unity was further strengthened by the general use of the Latin language. This universe approaches Galilean space-time at a great distance from matter. This vector displacement can naturally also be considered with respect to the co-ordinate system of the x?.
This vector has to be longer where the lines are denser, i.e., near the wire, shorter where the lines are less dense, i.e., far from the wire. This vector is always normal to the velocity-vector at P. Such a force-vector, representing a force at P, may be called a moving force-vector at P. Now the world-line passing through P will be described by a substantial point with the constant mechanical mass m. Let us call m-times the velocity-vector at P as the * Planck, Ziir Dynamik bewegter systeme, Ann. This vector representation may now be used to de- scribe the facts previously discussed concerning recti- linear motion. This view appears dull and naive to a twentieth- century physicist. This view is inspired by the success of field physics and the equivalence of mass and energy.
This view is made possiLle for us by the teaching of experience as to the existence of a field of farce, namely, the gravitational field, which possesses the remarkable property of imparting the same e.Eeeleration to all bodies. This view is not in harmony with the theory of Newton. This view is rendered the more natural by the fact that, according to Lorentzs theory, electro-magnetic radiation carries impulse and energy like ponderable matter, and that matter and radiation, according to the special theory of relativity, are both of them only particular forms of distributed energy, inasmuch as ponderable mat- ter loses its exceptional position and merely appears as a particular form of energy.
This view of axioms, advocated by modern axiomatics, purges mathematics of all extraneous elements, and thus dispels the mystic obscurity which formerly surrounded the principles of mathematics. This was a truly paradoxical situation because the theory seemed to restrict the inertial system more strongly than did classica! This was both simple and convincing. This was clearly formulated by Helmholtz about the middle of the nineteenth century : Finally, therefore, we discover the problem of physical material science to be to refer natural phenomena back to unchangeable attractive and repulsive forces whose intensity depends wholly upon distance. This was de Broglie's new and coura- geous idea. This was done in the famous Michelson-Morley experiment.
This was especially the case if one had a friend, as had I, who attended the lectures regularly and who worked over their content conscientiously. This was obviously due to the fact that my intuition was not strong enough in the field of mathematics in order to differentiate clearly the fundamentally important, that which is really basic, from the rest of the more or less dispensable erudition. This was possible because a mechanical system consisting of n mass points is mathematically equivalent to a considerable degree, to one single mass point moving in a space of 3 n dimensions. This was possible on the basis of the law of the constancy of the velocity of tight. This was the procedure of Lorentz in creating bis electron theory and the theory of the electromagnetic phe?
This was, in fact, one of the most important clues from which the so-called general theory of relativity was developed. This will allow itself to be expressed by introducing into (51), in place of the energy-components of the gravitational field alone, the sums t; + T;of theenergy? This will be the case if the walls of the cavity are also at the same temperature T, do not let radiation pass through and are not completely reflective. This will depend on the medium, being different for water and air, for example. This word ether has changed its meaning many times in the development of science. This world may consist of musical notes as well as of mathematical rules. This would be better for France than to have to permit compulsory service in Germany.
This would be much easier, though quite superfluous, at the end of the book. This would be the case in a certain finite region with reference to a definite co-ordinate system K^,. This would be very difficult to answer. This would have been the only way, besides carrying the waves, in which ether could mark and justify its existence. This would mean a financial relief and increased security for both of them. This would mean that there exists one c.s. This would prove that they do not oppose war for their own private comfort or because they are cowards or because they do not want to serve their own country or humanity. This would simply have been im- possible if there had existed only the sun, the earth and the fixed stars, but no other planets. This yields for the pressure p of the gas .
This, according to quantum mechanics, can be done only with the help of further measurements, by a process known as the reduction of the wave packet. This, again, is a consequence of the theory. This, for the time being, is the only justification for our elaborate construction of the field. This, however, is what actually happened. This, however, must have a well defined value does not, in any sense, describe the condition of one a single system. This, in a certain sense, is inconsistent; strictly speaking m.easuring rods and clocks would have to be represented as solutions of the basic equations (objects con- sisting of moving atomic configura- tions), not, as it were, as theoretically self-sufficient entities.
This, indeed, is a tragedy of overwhelming pmgnancyI However poignant that tragedy is, it is perhaps even more tragic that, while mankind has produced many scholars so extremely successful in the field of science and technology, we have been for a long time so inefficient in finding adequate solutions to the many politica!conflicts and economie tensions which beset us. This, moreover, is also the only method by which athe worst damage can be prevented. This, of course, is not the case. This, of course, means going over to the case of straight-line motion. This, of itself, represents a great formai simplification. This, our most valuable possession, has been paid far by the martyr' s blood of pure and great men, far whose sake Italy is still loved and revered today.

This, supposingit to be a reality, could only produce a scarcity of goods, not an excessive supply.

Those achievements are based on the free? Those achievements are based on the freedom of thought and of teaching, on the principle that the desire for truth must take precedence of all other desires. Those elements are relatively scarce due to their Iesser stability. Those func- tions are only supposed to determine the mathematical probabilities of the occurrence of such structures if measurements were taken at a particular spot or in a certain state of motion. Those ideals and convictions which resulted from historical experience, from the craving for beauty and harmony, have been readily accepted in theory by man-and at aJl times, have been trampled upon by the same people under the pressure of their anima! Those instrumental goods whicb should serve to main?
Those of you who have carefully followed the preceding discussion are almost sure to expect that we should retain the principle of relativity, which appeals so convincingly to the intellect because it is so natural and simple. Those who are raging to-day against the ideals of reason and individual liberty and are trying to establish a spiritless State-slavery by brute force rightly see in us their irreconcilable foes. Those who have done most for the cause of international understanding, among them some of the leading artists, are being persecuted there. Those who would preserve the spirit must also look after the body to which it is attached.
Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality of the men who, surrounded by a sceptical world, have shown the way to those like-minded with themselves, scattered through the earth and the centuries.

Though our conduct seems so very different from that of the higher animals, the primary instincts are much alike in them and in us. Though religion may be that which determines the goal, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up. Though religion may be tl1at which determines tl1e 46 IDEAS AND OPINIONS goal, it has, nevertheless, leamed from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up. Though the feld concept had indeed displaced the concept of action at a distance, the electric and magnetic felds were not yet conceived as primary entities, but rather as states of ponderable matter which latter was treated as a continuum.
Thought is the organizing factor in man, intersected between the causal primary instincts and the resulting actions. Thought only began to take a new turn with the wave theory of light and the theory of the electromagnetic field of Faraday and Clerk Max- well. Thoughts on the World Economic Crisis If there is one thing that can give a layman in the sphere of economics the courage to express an opinion on the nature of the alarming economic difficulties of the present day, it is the hopeless confusion of opinions among the experts. Three definite numbers correspond to every point of the space; a definite point in space corresponds to every three numbers.
Three points A, B and C on a rigid body thus lie in a straight line when the points A and C being given, B is chosen such that the sum of the distances AB and BC is as short as possible. Three stages of the motion can be distinguished: the initial motion, the action of the force, and the final motion after the force has ceased to act. Through a pipe slightly widened at its orifice. Through addition follows the tensor character of Thus we get the desired proof for the fonr-vector, *A ^ J^^d hence for any four-vectors A as shown above. Through inner, outer and mixed multiplications of a tensor with the fundamental tensor, tensors of other kinds and of other ranks can be formed.

Through laborious research, both theoretical and experimental, the quantitative features of the kinetic theory were formed. Through many years of hard work he has devoted himself to this object with great in? Through many years of hard work he has devoted himself to this object with great intelligence and no less great determination, and done us all, and science, a service for which we cannot be too grateful. Through our campaign of public education on the simple facts of atomic energy and its social implications, we of the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists have pledged our utmost effort to this end. Through outer multiplication and one-fold reduction we get out of A and B^^ , the ^ jXV ' mixed tensor of the second rank D = A B^*" .
Through outer multiplication of the first with B and the 2nd with A we ffet tensors of the V fX ^ third rank. Through reduction according to indices v and o- {I.e., put- ting v= a"), the co-variant four vector V y D = D = A B is generated. Through repeated performance, this process brings it about that ideas and beliefs acquire and retain a strong eHective power even after the ends which gave them that power are long forgotten. Through television I see a picture which was sent some very short time before, whereas on the real clock I see what is taking place at the present moment.
Through the erection of the Hebrew University and similar institutions, the Jewish people will not only help their own national renaissance, but will enrich their moral culture and knowledge; and, as in centuries past, be directed to new and better ways than those which present world conditions necessarily entail for them. Through the founding of a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine, the Jewish people will again be in a position to bring their creative faculties into full play. Through the maze of facts and concepts we had to choose some highway which seemed to us most characteristic and significant.
Through the operation of a newly awakened sense of solidarity among the Jews, the scheme of colonizing Palestine launched by a handful of devoted and judicious leaders in the face of apparently insuperable difficulties, has already prospered so far that I feel no doubt about its permanent success. Through the re turn of Jews to Palestine, and thus back to normal and healthy economic life, Zion ism means, too, a productive function, which should enrich mankind at large. Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. Through them the primary instinct attaches itself to ends which become ever more distant.
Through this con- dition, in certain cases, the structure of Tik, not however its sign, is determined. Through this concept of space one reaches, moreover, an attitude in which any description of position is admittedly a description of contact; the state? Throughout all our efforts, in every dramatic QUANTA 313 struggle between old and new views, we recognize the eternal longing for understanding, the ever-firm belief in the harmony of our world, continually strengthened by the increasing obstacles to comprehension. Throughout the ages, this state of anarchy in international a:ffairs has infilcted indescribable su:ffering and destruction upon mankind; again and again it has depraved the develop?
Throughout the two centuries following Galileo's time such an endeavour, conscious or unconscious, is apparent in nearly all scientific creation. Throughout two hundred years of scientific research force and matter were the underlying con- cepts in all endeavours to understand nature. Ths commssion was to be a strictly internationa! Thus (G) may be chosen arbitrarily, and also parts of (P); all these laws are conventions. Thus A02/A2 would be the ratio of the Omeasured in motionO to the Omeasured at restO energy of a given light complex, if the volume of a light complex were the same, whether measured in K or in k. But this is not the case.
Thus Euclidean geometry does not hold even to a first approximation in the gravitational field, if we wish to take one and the same rod, independently of its place and orientation, as a realization of the same interval ; although, to be sure, a glance at and shows that the deviations to be ex? Thus Euclidean geometry does not hold in the gravi- tational field even in the first approximation, if we conceive that one and the same rod independent of its position and its orientation can serve as the measure of the same extension.
Thus I am led to my first axiom : the quest of international security involves the unconditional surrender by every nation, in a certain measure, of its liberty of action, its sovereignty that is to say, and it is clear beyond all doubt that no other road can lead to such security. Thus I cameN despite the fact that I was the son of entirely irreligious (Jewish) parentsNto a deep religiosity, which, however, found an abrupt ending at the age of twelve. Thus Lorentz succeeded in reducing all electromagnetic happenings to Maxwells equations for free space. Thus Presneliao convection compensation can have no possible application in this ease.
Thus Stokes' ether failed to satisfy the very motive which had led Stokes to formulate it^ namely, the desirabi- lity of constructing a "physical" medium. Thus T 's are the energy-components of the electro-magnetic field. Thus a displacement towards the red ought to take place for spectral lines produced at the surface of stars as compared with the spectral lines of the same element produced at the surface of the earth, the amount of this displacement being For the sun, the displacement towards the red predicted by theory amounts to about two millionths of the wave-length. Thus a fundamental distinction is made between geometrical and gravitational forces.
Thus a law of Nature can be formulated by putting all the components of a tensor equal to zero so that it is a general co-variant equation ; thus while we seek the laws of formation of the tensors, we also reach the means of establishing general CO-variant laws. Thus a perfectly definite value of u belongs to every point on the surface of the marble slab. Thus a point of mass can never leave the system ; and a more detailed investigation shows that the same thing applies to light-rays. Thus according to this theory space is exactly as Riemann guessed ^no longer absolute ; its structure depends on physical influences. Thus all facts of experience which support the electromagnetic theory also support the theory of relativity.
Thus all observations supporting classical theory also support general relativity. Thus all our previous conclusions based on general relativity would appear to be called in question. Thus arose one of the most dramatic situations in the history of science. Thus arose the idea of Zionism and the work of settlement in Palestine, the successful realization of which we have been permitted to witness, at least in its highly promising beginnings. Thus arose the special theory of relativity, which, moreover, welded together into comprehensible unities the elec- trical and magnetic fields, as well as mass and energy, or momentum and energy, as the case may be. Thus did we arrive at a principle of the "equiva? Thus distress and evil produce new distress and new evil.
Thus do we mortals achieve immortality in the permanent things which we create in common. Thus every theory which uses the concept of wave can, in general, be regarded as a mechanical theory. Thus for W>c we can alwaj-s choose X in such a way as to make Wv>c^f i.e., lWr/c- negative. Thus for a co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of Michelson and Morley is not shortened, but it is shortened for a co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun. Thus from the Newtonian point of view, these //'s represent the gravitational effect of matter while from the Relativity stand-point, these mereh' define the non-Newtonian (and incidentally non-Euclidean) spice in the neighbourhood of matter.
Thus great accuracy was necessary in making the adjustments required for the taking of the photographs, and in their subsequent measurement. Thus he was always thinking out new ways of inducing healthy muscles to take the place of lost ones, by ingenious transplantation of tendons. Thus heat, accofdlilgTo tKiiTpicture, is not a special form of energy different from the mechanical one but is just the kinetic energy of molecular motion. Thus here, too, the momentum transferred to the molecule is (smem)/c.
Thus if the spherical surface beings are living on a planet of which the solar system occupies only a negligibly small part of the spherical universe, they have no means of determining whether they are living in a finite or in an infinite universe, because the " piece of universe " to which they have access is in both cases practically plane, or Euclidean. Thus if we hold to (1) we are driven on to the path of Mie's theory.t Not only the problem of ma.tter, but the cosmological problem as well, leads to d oubt as to equation (1). Thus in a continuum theory, the atomistic character could be satisfactorily expressed by integral propositions without localizing the particles which constitute the atomistic system.
Thus in our example, the coincidence of the particle with the earth is characterized in our chosen c.s. Thus in reality, the description of the time-space continuum by means of Gauss co-ordinates completely replaces the description with the aid of a body of reference, without suffering from the defects of the latter mode of description; it is not tied down to the Euclidean character of the continuum which has to be represented. Thus in the general theory of relativity we must introduce a correspond- ing energy-tensor of matter T, which, like the energy-components trr [equations (49) and (50)) of the gravitational field, will bave mixed charaC:oer, but will pertain to a symmetrical covariant tensor.
Thus in total be covers the distance W=v+w relative to the embankment in the second considered. Thus inertia would indeed be influenced , but would not be conditioned by matter (present in finite space). Thus instead of (51) we obtain the tensor equation ..Cg"11T:11) = - tc[( t; + T;) -a o;(t + T)J,I a <52) ..j - g = l where we bave set T = T: (Laue's scalar). Thus instead of equations (47) we obta.in i)!.. Thus it happened that the goal of erecting a pure electromagnetic feld theory of matter remained unattained for the time being, although in principle no objection could be raised against the possibility of reaching such a goal. Thus it has become possible to test and confum tbe equivalence formula.
Thus it is always possible to construct physical laws in such a way that Ihey retain their f(rm when referred to moving coordinates, "^riie ultimate ground for formulating physi- cal laws in this way is merely a subjective conviction that the principle of relativity is uuiversally true. Thus it is clear from (8) and (9) that in this sense, we can look upon contravariant four-vectors, as eontravariant tensors of the first rank. Thus it is clear that the difference H?E can differ from the kinetic energy K of the body, with respect to the other system (?,?,? Thus it is probably out of the question that any future knowledge can compel physics again to relinquish our present statistical theoretical foundation in favor of a deter?
Thus it is that mathematicians long ago solved the formal problems to which we are led by the general postulate of relativity. Thus it may become possible to " transform away '' gravitational effects, at least for sufficiently small regions of space, by referring all movements to a new set of axes. Thus it might turn out that only such regular many-bridge solutions can exist for which the "charges" of the electrical bridges are numeri- cally equal to one another and only two different "masses" occur for the mass bridges, and for which the stationary "motions" are subject to restric- tions like those which we encounter in the quan- tum theory.
Thus it was that Kepler discovered the true shape of the earth's orbit and the way in which the earth describes it, and we who come after Europeans, Germans, or even Swabians, may well admire and honor him for it. Thus its permanent existence must be characterised by an infinitely large number of such systems of values, the co-ordinate values of which are so close together as to give continuity; corresponding to the material point, we thus have a (uni-dimensional) line in the fourdimensional continuum. Thus just two complementary guesses are needed for quantitative conclusions concerning the motion of the planets.
Thus neither Maxwell's original theory nor its subse- quent modifications as developed by Hertz and Heaviside succeeded in obtainiuii; a value for Fresnelian co-efficient equal to 1 V/^^j ^^^ consequently stood totall3^ condemned from the optical point of view. Thus not the velocity itself but its change is a consequence of pushing or pulling. Thus on our circular disc, or, to make the case more general, in every gravitational field, a clock will go more quickly or less quickly, according to the position in which the clock is situated (at rest). Thus our procedure will somewhat re? Thus physicists held to a field-theory program.
Thus schools may interfere with the development of inward freedom through authoritarian influences and through imposing on young people excessive spiritual burdens; on the other hand, schools may favor such freedom by encouraging independent thought. Thus schools may interfere with the development of inward freedom througiyauthoritarian influences and through imposing on youygpeople excessive spiritual burdens; on tbe otber hand MORALS AND EMOTIONS. Thus science seems to be at war with itself: when it most means to be objective, it finds itself plunged into subjectivity against its will. Thus sea waves have greater wave-length than river waves. Thus so far as the electromagnetic laws are concerned, the princi])le of relativity cau he proveiJ to he irue.
Thus such a universe could not be inhabited by matter everywhere ; it would present to us that unsatisfactory picture which we portrayed in Section 30. Thus tbe vanishing of the Riemann tensor is a necessary condition that, by an appropriate choice of the system of reference, the g,,.v may be constants. Thus the .above group of experiments with moving dielectrics directly contradicted the Hertz- Heaviside theory. Thus the Einsteinian Principle of Relativity asserts that all physical laws are independent of the ^absolute' velocity of an observer. Thus the Hertz- Heaviside form of field equations gives unity as the value for the Fresnelian convection co-efficient.
Thus the arbitrary smallness of the steps connecting two distant points, each of which can be represented by two numbers, is again characteristic of a two-dimensional continuum. Thus the chain of our argument is : motion of charge -> change of an electric field I current -> associated magnetic field. Thus the clock goes more slowly if set up in the neighbourhood of ponderable masses. Thus the complete agreement of experimental facts witli the predictions of the new theory must be considered as confirming it as a principle which goes even beyond the electron itself. Thus the convection- coefficient implying some type of a stationary or viscous, yet nevertheless "absolute" ether, succeeded in explaining satisfactorily all known optical facts down to 1880.
Thus the desire for unity in our view of the nature of these forces led to the hypothesis of the ether. Thus the effect will be perceived before the cause commences to act, i.e., the future will precede the past. Thus the electromafrneric laws of Maxwell and Lorentz can he (lefinitehj jiroved " to be independent of the manner in which they are referred to two coordinate systems whicb have a uniform translatory motion relative to each other." Thus the endeavour toward a unified view of the nature of forces leads to the hypothesis of an ether. Thus the equations of quantum physics determine the probability wave just as Maxwell's equations determine the electromagnetic field and the gravitational equa- tions determine the gravitational field.
Thus the experiments de- scribed enable us to measure the wave-length of the homogeneous light used as a source. Thus the fact that an atom of a certain element emits radiation of one wave-length only, that is photons of a definite energy only, could be expressed differently: only two energy levels are permissible in an atom of this element and the emission of a photon corresponds to the transition of the atom from the higher to the lower energy level. Thus the field equations of gravitation contain four con? Thus the kinetic theory of gases seeks to reduce mechanical, thermal and diffusional processes to movements of molecules i.e., to build them up out of the hypothesis of molecular motion.
Thus the latter theory is obtained here without any particular assumption, whereas Newton had to introduce the hypothesis that the force of attraction between mutually attracting material points is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Thus the law of the parallelogram of velocities is valid according to our theory only to a first approximation. Thus the length of the train as measured from the embankment may be different from that obtained by measuring in the train itself. Thus the lines in our draw- ing indicate the direction of the attracting force of the sun for different positions of the test body. Thus the lines serve a double purpose. Thus the negation of (1) leads to the negation of the only other alternative (2).
Thus the new theory of gravitation diverges widely from that of Newton with respect to its basic principle. Thus the newly introduced universal consta.nt E defines both the mean density of distribution p which can remain in equilibrium a.nd also the radius R and the volume 27r2 R3 of spherical space. Thus the number of lines of force passing through the surface F of the sphere into its interior is proportional to p0 V. For unit area of the surface of the sphere the number of lines of force which enters the sphere is thus proportional to p0 V/F or to p0R. Thus the only justification for our mental structures is whether and in what way our theories form such a link.
Thus the original, immediate relation between geometry and physical reality appears destroyed, and we feel impelled toward the following more general view, which characterizes Poincare's standpoint. Thus the original, immediate relation between geometry and physical reality appears destroyed, and we feel impelled toward the following more general view, which characterizes Poincares standpoint. Thus the partial differential equation entered the- oretical physics as a handmaid, but has gradually become mistress. Thus the physicists were bound to arrive at the theory of the quasi-rigid luminiferous ether, the parts of which can carry out no movements relatively to one another except the small movements of deformation which correspond to light-waves.
Thus the purely mechanical view of nature was gradually abandoned. Thus the required equations of the matter-free gravita- tional ficld rnust in any case be satisfied if all Br vanish. Thus the responsible leaders of all governments are obliged to act on the assumption of eventual war. Thus the scalar of curvature is constant on every world-line of. Thus the science of thermodynamics seeks by analytical means to deduce necessary con- nections, which separate events have to satisfy, from the universally experienced fact that perpetual motion is impossible. Thus the story goes on until we have arrived at a system of the greatest con? Thus the theoretical view of the actual universe, if it is in correspondence with our reasoning, is the following.
Thus the validity of the Special Theory is completely preserved within its own restricted field. Thus the vector drawn represents the velocity at a given instant. Thus the velocity of light is the absolute maximum velocity. Thus the velocity shows whether or not external forces are acting on a body. Thus the wave-length can only change discontinuously. Thus the wit was not wrong who defined educa? Thus the wit was not wrong who defined education in tbis way: "Education is tlrnt wbich remains, if one has fargotten every? Thus there remains only the first term in round brackets to be considered, so that, taking (31) into ac? Thus they awakened the nations from their sluggish dullness. Thus they have fed the fear of other countries that they consider the bomb a legiti?
Thus they reach only their own kind who are already convinced, and do not advance very far. Thus this contra- diction forces us to introduce a somewhat more subtle theory. Thus this is the direction in which the force acts on a magnetic pole at this point. Thus tlie electromagnetic efPect outside a moving medium should be proportional to K, the specific inductive capacity. Thus to define the sixteen independent quan tities g". Thus to the geometrical reality of the concept of space a new inertia-determining function of space was added. Thus two essential steps led to Maxwell's equations.
Thus w< get both in the case of Arago prism experiment an( Airy -Boscovitch water-telescope experiment, the ver startling result that optical effects in a moving mediun seem to be quite independent of the volocit}^ of th medium with respect to Fresnel's stationary ether. Thus we also see that the antisymmetrical tensor ^^^ (3rd rank) has only 4 components numerically different, and the antisymmetrical tensor A only one. Thus we are starting toward another war degraded by our own choice. Thus we can draw conclusions about the geometrical structure of the universe only if we base our considerations on the state of the matter as being something that is known.
Thus we conclude further that if the wave character of matter QUANTA 293 can be detected, it should be done experimentally in an analogous way to that of X-rays. Thus we could hope for more statesmen and fewer diplomats. Thus we get (by slightly changing the indices) the tensor of the third rank a'^A (iKT^b^ CfJiT^ dA. Thus we have found the two most important pillars of support for the theory of the electric and magnetic field. Thus we have obtained a physical interpretation of this law. Thus we have obtained the Lorentz transformation for events on the x-axis. Thus we may also say, I think, that the ether of the general theory of relativity is the outcome of the Lorentzian ether, through relativation.
Thus we may conclude that the mental development of the individual and his way of forming concepts depend to a high degree upon language. Thus we obtain (40) This is the expression for the divergence of a contravariant six-vector. Thus we obtain ten equations for the ten quantities g,..v, which are satisfied in the special case of the vanishing of all BI':'..,.. With the choice which we have made of a system of co-ordinates, &nd taking (44) into considera? Thus we obtain where B:.., () {u, p} + () {T , p} - {u, a}{aT, p} . Thus we of the older generation look to you and hope that you will strive with all your might to achieve what was denied to us. Thus we reach an interpretation of the relation of science to religion which is very different from the customary view.
Thus we see from our drawing that < >E although the following sentence sounds intricate, it is nevertheless correct and expresses something very simple. Thus we see that in the case of gravitational force we have succeeded in expressing, in a simple way, the dependence of the force on the distance between the moving bodies. Thus we see that it is possible by our theory to determine the velocity of the electron from the ratio of the magnetic power of deflexion Am to the electric power of deflexion Ae, for any velocity, by applying the law Am v = . Thus we see that not only the corpuscular theory, but also the wave theory, leads to an explanation of refraction.
Thus we see the breakdown of the old theory, or to be more exact, we see that the substance theory is limited to problems of heat flow. Thus with the help of certain imaginary physical experiments we have settled what is to be understood by synchronous stationary clocks located at different places, and have evidently obtained a definition of simultaneous, or synchronous, and of time. Thus with the help of certain physical experiences, w^e have established what we understand when we speak of clocks at rest at different stations, and synchronous with one another ; and thereby we have arrived at a definition of synchronism and time. Thus you can not only defend yourself successfully but you can serve your country and your descenants in a degree as was not given to any prev1ous generation.
Thus ~ becomes zero c and it appears from the figure that the hyperbola is gradu- ally shrunk into the /-axis, the asymptotic angle be- comes a straight one, and every special transformation in the limit changes in such a manner that the /-axis can have any possible direction upwards, and ,'' more and more approximates to . Thus, according to Helmholtz, the line of development of science is determined and follows strictly a fixed course : And its vocation will be ended as soon as the reduction of natural phenomena to simple forces is complete and the proof given that this is the only reduction of which the phenomena are capable. Thus, according to tbe general theory of relativity, gravi?
Thus, also the temperature has been expressed indirectly in terms of the energy and the other given quantities. Thus, by measuring either A or 8 we are in a position to predict with certainty, and without in any way This q, however, is the eigenfunction of the operator (17) disturbing the second system, either the value of the quantity P (that is p)) or the ~alue of the quantity Q (that is q). Thus, far example, the series of integers is obviously an in? Thus, for example, from the mixed tensor of the fourth rank A:,we obtain the mixed tensor of the second rank, A; = . Thus, for example, tbe tensors T arise out of the tensors A and B of different kinds, Tv<T = AvB.,., T.vuT = A.vBuT , T"v'T = AvBuv. Thus, for example, the future paths of all planets can be foreseen.
Thus, for example, the series of integers is obviously an invention of the human mind, a self-created tool which simplifies the ordering of certain sensory experiences. Thus, for instance, for one electron we could ask about the probability of meeting an electron in some particular spot. Thus, if a linear element (PG or P'G') starting from the points P or P', is given, then the magnitude of this linear element can be calculated by the aid of the relevant local n-leg from its local co-ordinates by means of Pythagorass theorem.
Thus, if we choose as time-variable the imaginary variable instead of the real quantity t, we can regard the space-time contintium N accordance with the special theory of relativity N as a ", Euclidean " four-dimensional continuum, a result which follows from the considerations of the preceding section. Thus, if we correct the observed motion of the planets for these two influences, and if Newton's theory be strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the orbit of the planet an ellipse, which is fixed with reference to the fixed stars.
Thus, in the enquiry now proposed, I can do little more than seek to clarify the ques- tion at issue and, clearing the ground of the more obvious solutions, enable you to bring the light of your far-reaching knowledge of man's instinctive life to hear upon the problem. Thus, in the framework of the original theory one has the gravitational equations R;I,-'g'aR = T.I;, (4) where T;I, is the tensor of mass or energy density. Thus, it is of vital importance for the preservation of true religion that such conllicts be avoided when RELIGION AND SCIENCE: m.RECONCILABLE? Thus, it is possible to assign two different wave functions (in our example )Ih and e) to the same reality (the second system after the interaction with the first).
Thus, it would surely be inappropriate to judge the value of the Talmud by its intellectual fruits. Thus, one obtains the remarkable result that the relation between the kinetic energy and the pressure turns out to be precisely the same as in the classical theory, where it is derived from the virial theorem. Thus, our verdict of motion or rest depends upon whether or not all the physical laws are applicable to a given c.s. Thus, such way, whenever the conditions set down in it occur. Thus, taking (14), (15), and (16) into consideration, we obtain, in the first place, the equation (16). Thus, the changes brought about by the relativity theory are not surprising.
Thus, the conclusion was that the ether was moving relative to our instruments, and that this relative motion changed over the course of a day and of a year. Thus, the difference is quantitative, not qualitative. Thus, the diversity in the measurement of lengths and temporal rates is merely due to the static difference in the " frame-work ^' of the different observers. Thus, the electric charge has a granular structure and most important from the point of view of the quantum theory so has energy. Thus, the law of the macroscopic distribution of states for the thermodynamic equilibrium is fully determined. Thus, the result of our considerations, supported by more detailed and technical argument, is: The velocity of light does not depend on the motion of the emitting source.
Thus, the transformation that converts dS2 = d$12d$22 d( 2+Cf/42 into (1) is $1=x1 cosh (1x4, $3 =X3, &4=x1 sinh nx4. Thus, the velocity does not show whether or not external forces are act- ing on a body. Thus, there is nothing else lef t far me but to speak about such questions as, independently of space and time, always bave been and will be connected with educational matters. Thus, there is nothing else lef t far me but to speak about such questions as, independently of space and time, always have been and will be connected with educational matters. Thus, this is one of the principal steps leading to Maxwell's equations. Thus, when v = c, W becomes infinite. Thus, with this choice of co-ordinates, only substitutions for which the determinant is unity are permissible.
Tiie g 's then have the values given in (4). Time and again he raised his voice in protest against the Nazi barbarians. Time is determined by clocks, space co-ordinates by rods, and the result of their determination may depend on the behaviour of these clocks and rods when in motion. Time, and therefore such words as "simultaneously", "sooner", "later", had an absolute meaning independent of any c.s. Tlms one tries to secure the favor of these beings by carrying out actions and offering sacrifices which, according to the tradition handed down from genera? Tne bold notion of "space" which preceded all scienti:fc geometry transformed our mental concept of the relations of positions of bodily objects into the notion of the position of these bodily objects in "space."
To "visualise" a theory, or bring it home to one's mind, therefore means to give a representation to that abundance of experiences for which the theory supplies the schematic arrangement. To Einstein is also due the resusciation of Planck's quantum theory of energy-emission. To Sigmund Freud Dear Professor Freud, It is admirable the way the longing to perceive the truth has overcome every other desire in you. To a man wbo in a conversation during the first World War tried to convince him that in the human sphere fate is deter? To accomplish this is the task of the genera! To accomplish this, we need only add the proposition: Solid bodies are related, with respect to their possible dispositions, as are bodies in Euclidean geometry of three dimensions.
To accomplish this, we need only add the proposition:Solid bodies are related, with respect to their possible dispositions, as are bodies in Euclidean geometry of three dimensions. To account for this fact, Einstein made the bold assumption that the light is propogated in space as a unit pulse (he calls it a Light-cell), and falHng upon an individual atom, liberates electrons according to the energy equation hv=-;^mv^ -\- A, where (iu, v) are the mass and velocity of the electron. To act intelligently in human aff airs is only possible if an attempt is made to understand the thoughts, motives, and apprehensions of one's opponent so fully that one can see the world through bis eyes.
To all concerned in it I feel impelled to call out in the name of men of good will with a care for the future: "In this hour of opened eyes and awakening conscience we feel ourselves united with you by the deepest ties." To allow thermal equilibrium, the variations in the radiation presure must be such that, on average, it compensates for the plate's loss of speed due to radiation friction. To answer this question at all implies a religion. To any American all this may be a platitude, but not to any European. To any definite temperature there corresponds a definite average kinetic energy per molecule. To any system of values x, y, z, t, which completely defines the place and time of an event in the stationary system, there belongs a system of values ?, ?, ?
To any time of the stationary system K there then will correspond a definite position of the axes of the moving system, and from reasons of symmetry we are entitled to assume that the motion of k may be such that the axes of the moving system are at the time t (this t always denotes a time of the stationary system) parallel to the axes of the stationary system. To arm is to give one's voice and make one's preparations not for peace but for war. To arrive at Newton's theory a s a first approximation we had to calculate only one component, 944, of the ten 911- of the gravitational field, since this CC.J:> ponent alone enters into the first approximation, (67), of tL equation for the motion of the materia!
To arrive at a certain answer to this question, let us proceed in the opposite direction of Planck in his radiation theory. To arrive at results consistent witb the relevant experiments, radiation of a given frequency had to be treated as though it consisted of energy atoms of the individua} energy h.v., where b is Planck's universal con? To assume a wave in empty space really means not to assume any wave at all. To assume that two bodies contain equal quantities of heat just because their temperatures are equal would, as Black remarked, be taking a very hasty view of the subject. To avoid ambiguity we shall say that the magnetic pole brought nearer to the wire is the positive one.
To be able to make such assertions, geometry must be stripped of its merely logical-formal character by the co-ordination of real objects of experience with the empty conceptual frame-work of axiomatic geometry. To be called to account publicly for everything one has said, even in jest, in an excess of high spirits or in momentary anger, may possibly be awkward, yet up to a point it is reasonable and natural. To be specific it becomes 2x2=4 times smaller if the distance is doubled, 3x3 = 9 times smaller if the distance is made three times as great. To be sure, Maxwell still tried to interpret his field theory mechamcally by means of mechanical ether models. To be sure, gravity, that is to say, a force acting at a distance, does play an important part in every day experience.
To be sure, it did not happen to be possible to associate a definite movement, in the sense of mechanics of materia! To be sure, it has been pointed out that the introduction of a space-time continuum may be considered as contrary to nature in view of the molecular structure of everything which happens on a small scale. To be sure, it is not the fruits of scientific research that elevate a man and enrich his nature, but the urge to understand, the intellectual work, creative or receptive. To be sure, it is not the fruits of scientifrc research that elevate a man and enrich his nature, but the urge to understand, the intellectual work, creative or receptive. To be sure, nature distributes her gif ts unevenly among her chil?
To be sure, nature distributes her gifts variously among her children. To be sure, the doctrine of a persona!God interfering with natural events could never be refuted , in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot. To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted , in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot. To be sure, the frst World War had already shaken this feel? To be sure, this weakness was formally avoided in the original theory of relativity by the introduction of the energy tensor into the field equations.
To be sure, we are concerned here with nonconformism in a remote field of endeavor, and no Senatoria! To be sure, when the number of factors coming into play in a phenomenological complex is too large scientific method in most cases fails us. To be sure, when tlie number of factors conng into play in a phenomenological complex is tao large, scientilic metliod in most cases fails us. To begin with I believe with Schopenhauer that one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of ones own ever shifting desires.
To begin with it was apparent from observations of the sun that the apparent path of the sun against the background of the fixed stars differed in speed at different times of the year, but that the angular velocity of this movement was always the same at the same point in the astronomical year, and therefore that the speed of rotation of the straight line earth-sun was always the same when it pointed to the same region of the fixed stars. To begin with, a bar magnet is kept at rest near a solenoid which forms a closed circuit. To believe this is logically possible without contradiction; but, it is so very contrary to my scientific instinct that I cannot forego the search for a more complete conception.
To bring this home to men all over the world is the most important and most fateful social function intellectuals have ever had to shoulder. To change the position of such a body it is necessary to exert some influence upon it, to push it or lift it, or let other bodies, such as horses or steam engines, act upon it. To clear the way leading from theory to experiment of unnecessary and artificial assumptions, to embrace an ever-wider region of facts, we must make the chain longer and longer.
To compute the numerical value of the constant a, one would have to have an exact theory of 69 electrodynamic and mechanical processes; for the present, one has to confine oneself to a treatment of the limiting case of Rayleigh's law for high temperatures, for which the classical theory is valid in the limit. To continue with the experiment we move the pole of the magnet held in the hand along the other magnet. To convince ourselves of tbis impossibility, !et us imagine two clocks of identica! To decide this question, Fizeau performed an important interference experiment, based on the following line of reasoning. To deny the ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever.
To deny the existence of the ether means, in the last analysis, denying all physical properties to empty space. To design the field of a positively charged sphere, we must ask what kind of forces are acting on a small positively charged test body brought near the source of the field, the charged sphere. To determine the usefulness and range of validity of the theory, however, we must investigate new and more complicated facts. To do the latter is, however, obligatory if one wants to do justice to the equality of gravitational and inert mass by means of the basis of the theory, and if one wants to overcome Mach's paradox as concerns the inertial sys- tems. To do this we had to interrupt our story and introduce the concept of waves.
To do this, let us leave for the moment the problem of heat and return to mechanics. To draw quantitative conclusions we must use the language of mathematics. To each event belongs, besides its place coordinates x, y, z, a time value t. The latter was considered measurable by a dock (ideal periodic process ) of negligible spatial extent. To ensure the equality of the diagonals, we make use of a little testing-rod. To ensure this feature of tbe tbeory, we make tbe following assmnption ' (6) where @ is to depend only on the gv, gv, g: , and rol only on gv, q( p), q( p )aa Equations (4), (4a) then assume the form i) Cl *) - - @* rol (7) nXa gv gv gv ( rol ) rol = o (8) nX a q( p)a )q( p).
To escape from it people took the reverse line of trying to reduce mechanical concepts to electrical ones. To establish this connection, let us take a positive para- meter c y and let us consider the figure According to the analogy of the hyperboloid of two sheets, this consists of two sheets separated by t-=^o. To estimate this objection at its proper worth, one must realize that a reciprocal relation exists between external machinery and internal states of mind. To every point in our time-space continuum there corresponds a pair of numbers, one of which denotes the time, and the other the space, co-ordinate. To every point of a continuum are assigned as many numbers (Gaussian coordinates) as the continuum has dimensions.
To every space R at a time t, belongs a positive quantitythe mass at R at the time /. To every value of (r, y, z, t) which fully determines the position and time of^ an event in the static uary system, there correspond-; a system of values {^,y],'C'T) ; now the problem is to find out the system of equations connect- ing these magnitudes. To few men in the world has such an experience been vouchsafed. To fili this lacuna-at least scantily-1 took his book Logie and Scientific M ethod, which he had published jointly with Emest Nagel. To find the correct answer we must think a little more deeply about the cart on a perfectly smooth road. To find the positions of two points relative to different c.s., we have to use transformation laws.
To find this out, Planck divided the total energy into parts of equal energy . To follow up these ideas demands the know- ledge of a highly refined technique of investigation. To form this expression, we note first, that ?ds2 = d?2 = ? To give an idea of how small the numbers are we shall cite two wave- lengths, those representing the extremes of the solar spectrum, that is, the red and the violet. To give any estimate when atomic energy can be applied to c nstructive purposes is impossible. To grasp how difficult a business it was even to find out about the actual rotating movements, one has to realize the following. To grasp the full gravity of the situation it is necessary to bear in mind the following consideration. To hazard a prophecy here would be presumption.
To him Maxwell's equations in empty space held only far a particular coordinate system distinguished from all other coordinate systems by its state of rest. To him who is a discoverer in this field the products of his imagination appear so necessary and natural that he regards them, and would like to have them regarded by others, not as creations of thought but as given realities. To illustrate the ideas involved let us consider the quantum-mechanical description of the behavior of a particle having a single degree of freedom. To imagine a jelly as a medium made up of particles in such a way that transverse waves are propagated by means of it is no easy task. To imagine a space means nothing else than that we imagine an epitome of our " space " experience, i.e.
To include this experiment in the theory, Lorentz and FitzGerald introduced the postulate that all objects, including the parts of Michelson and Morley's experimental set-up, changed their form in a certain way, if they moved relative to the ether. To inquire after the meaning or object of one's own existence or of creation generally has always seemed to me absurd from an objective point of view. To interpret (1) in the framework of this theory we must approximate the line element by a slightly different one which avoids the singularity g=0. To interpret these equations physically, we introduce the real light-time l and the velocity v of K' relatively to K, instead of the imaginary angle ?

To justify this confidence of mine, I must necessarily avail myself of mathematicalconcepts. To keep a stockpile of atomic bombs without promising not to initiate its use is exploiting the possession of the bombs far politica! To know an answer to this question means to be religious. To know the difference between the classical and Lorentz transformations.
To link this simple but highly important experimental result with the identity of the two masses needs some rather in- tricate reasoning. To make clear these fundamental ends and valuations, and to set them fast in the emotional!ife of the individua!, seems to me precisely the most important function which religion has to perform in the social !ife of man. To make its efforts more effective, the French Government has decided to create and maintain a permanent Institute for intellectual co-operation, which is just now to be opened. To make its efforts more effective, the French government has decided to create and maintain a permanent Institute of Intellectual Co? To me the real problem is this: Why do so many Europeans and Americans bother so much about the little handful of Jews?
To me the worst thing seems to be far a school principally to work with methods of fear, farce, and artificial authority. To me the worst thing seems to be for a school principally to work with methods of fear, force and artifcial authority. To me, the Thora and the Talmud are merely the most important evidence for the manner in which the Jewish conception of life held sway in earlier times. To nqure after the meaning or object of one's own existence or that of al! To observe and predict events in nature we must consider not only the place but also the time of physical happenings. To obtain even a partial solution the scientist must collect the unordered facts available and make them coherent and understandable by creative thought.
To obtain such a result however requires a certain extension of the hypotheses, which had been up to now solely concerned with an exchange The question arises: does the molecule suffer an impulse when it emits or absorbs energy e? To obtain the energy-components T; of the electromagnetic :field, we need only give to equation "u = O the form of equation (57) . To outline some of the characteristic features of Maxwell's theory, let us, for the moment, focus all our attention on one of these experiments, say, on that of Faraday. To proceed with the experiment, we bring electric fluid to the metal conductor by touching it with the rubber. To push the piston down force must be used acting against the inner pressure of the gas.
To put it boldly, it is the attempt at the posterior reconstruction of existence by the process of conceptualization. To put it in another way, if only a relative meaning can be attached to the concept of velocity, ought we nevertheless to persevere in treat- ing acceleration as an absolute concept? To raise new questions, new possibili- ties, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science. To resolve this question, Planck utilized the general relationship between entropy and the probability of a state, as derived by Boltzmann from his investigations in the theory of gases. To return to physics, the motion of material particles must be considered.
To rnake clear these fundarnental ends and valuations, and to set them fast in the emotional lif e of the individuai, seems to me precisely the rnost important function which religion has to perform in the social life of man. To satisfy the needs of the wodd today nothing like all the available labor is wanted. To satisfy the needs of the world to-day nothing like all the available labour is wanted. To say tbat a point-event has the X1 co? To say tbat a. point-event bas the X4 co-ordinate x4 = t, means tbat a standard clock , made to measure time in a definite unit period, and whicb is stationary relatively to tbe system of co-ordinates and practic? To say that one of the distant events happens before the other has now a definite meaning.
To see this vividly, we have to remind ourselves that before Newton there existed no self-contained system of physical causality which was capable of representing any of the deeper features of the empirical world. To see this, we first observe tbat " xc,p,, is a covariant vector, if + and cp are scalars. To see whether the mechanical point of view can be applied to the description of electrical phenomena, we must consider the following problem. To see with one's own eyes, to feel and judge without suc? To show that the field equations correspond to the laws of momentum and energy, it is most convenient to write them in the following Hamiltonian form :- . To show the meaning of these words more clearly, let us take a simple example.
To simplify matters we shall investigate only motion along straight lines. To simplify the calculation we shall only consider the case where the motions take place in just one direction, the Xdirection of the coordinate system. To specify relations in time, we require in addition a standard clock placed, say, at the origin of our Cartesian system of coordinates or frame of reference. To start with, he places one of two identically constructed clocks at the centre of the circular disc, and the other on the edge of the disc, so that they are at rest relative to it. To start with, he saw that it was necessary first to .try and find out about the motion of the earth itself.
To start with, it disturbed me that electro-dynamics should pick out one state of motion in preference to others, without any experimental justification for this preferential treatment. To sum up, we can say that in the Euclidean geometry there are (in a given space of reference) preferred systems of co-ordinates, the Cartesian systems, which transform into each other by linear orthogonal transformations. To tack this on to the idea of God seems mere childish absurdity. To take into account all these various possibilities, to discuss their particular influ- ences, would necessarily lead to a very complicated theory.
To test whether this prediction was true, Fizeau let two coherent, monochromatic beams pass axially each through their own water-filled pipe and then interfere with one another. To that must be added the moral deterioration resulting from a ruthless economie struggle. To the " linear element " in question, or to the two infin? To the Schoolchildren of Japan In sending this greeting to you Japanese schoolchildren, I can lay claim to a special right to do so. To the line-element considered, i.e., to both the infi- nitely near point-events belong also definite differentials <^Xj, d.c^, dx^, do^, of the four-dimensional co-ordinates of any chosen system of reference.
To the mathematician, accustomed on the one hand to the methods of treatment of the poly-dimensional manifold, and on the other hand to the conceptual figures ot the so-called non-Euclidean Geometr^y, there can be no difficulty in adopting this concept of time to the application of the Lorentz-transformation. To the middle of the lid of the chest is fixed externally a hook with rope attached, and now a " being " (what kind of a being is immaterial to us) begins pulling at this with a constant force. To the- classical mechanics (no less than) to the special relativity theory, is attached an episteomologioal defect, which was perhaps first clea'ly pointed out by E. Mach. To these angles correspond the angles <p and ip, which determine the direction of dx in K in an analogous manner.
To these considerations we should add those of another kind which also voice their plea against the idea that the methods introduced by quantum mechanics are likely to I give a usef ul basis for the whole of physics. To these difficulties there bad to be added the polar cbaracter of tbese kinds of matter wbicb did not fit into the scbeme of classica!mecbanics. To these must be added the life-preserving achievements of biology and medicine, especially the production of pain re? To these serving hands mine also shall belong. To these, physics had to be adapted. To this I answer: In my opinion all this is of secondary importance. To this I answer: in my opinion ali this is of secondary im?
To this I answerwith complete assurance,that in my opinion there is the correct path and, moreover, that it is in our power to find it. To this I must reply that such a testimony as you suggest would have been equivalent to a repudiation of all those notions of justice and liberty for which I have all my life stood. To this also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid for the world of existence are rational, that is, compre? To this category belong the scientific institutions and workers on whose work not merely the well-being of science but also the position occupied by Germany and Austria in the scale of culture very largely depends.
To this end we think of space and time physically defined with respect to two inertial systems, K and K', in the way that has been shown. To this end, we apply the defining equation of the entropy to an infinitesimally small, isopycnic heating and get d , which, on taking recourse to (9), (6), and (7), yields d or 1 = B (13) . To this motion of K1 against the 34ther ("34ther-drift " relative to K1) were attributed the more complicated laws which were supposed to hold relative to K1. To this particular radiation there corresponds a particular radiation in K' which is similarly characterised by a frequency range dv' and a certain solid angle dx'. To this point we shall return very soon. To this square we add similar ones, each of which has one rod in common with the first.
To this there also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid far the world of existence are rational, that is, comprehensible to reason. To this transfer of energy there also corresponds a momentum transfer from radiation bundle to resonator, by momentum conservation. To this two-dimensional sphere-universe there is a three-dimensional analogy, namely, the three-dimensional spherical space which was discovered by Riemann.
To transform a space-time point P {x^ y, :, i) to rest is equivalent to introducing, by means of a Lorentz transfor- mation, a new system of reference ( ', y' , z' , t'), in which the t' axis has the direction Oc\', OA' indicating the direc- tion of the space-time line passing through P. The space ^' = const, which is to be laid through P, is the one which is perpendicular to the space-time line through P. To the increment dt of the time of P corresponds the increment dT=Vdt^'-d.io''-dy^ d;^=dtVlir" of the newly introduced time parameter /'. To two selected materiai points of a stationary rigid body there always corresponds a distance of quite definite length, which is independent of the locality and orientation of the body, and is also independent of the time.
To two selected positions of the hands of a clock at rest relatively to the privileged system of reference there always corresponds an interval of time of a definite length, which is indepeadent of place and time. To understand these phenomena it is wise to begin with the simplest possible cases, and proceed gradually to the more complicated ones. To use a comparison, we could say that creating a new theory is not like destroying an old barn and erect- uTits piarq, ^lt is rather like climEing a mountain, gaining new and wider views, discovering cuimeaions b^twe^Trouf^IarnHg^point and its rich environment. To use the field concept and its language consistently, we must regard the magnetic field as a store of energy.
To visualise a theory, or bring it home to ones mind, therefore means to give a representation to that abundance of experiences for which the theory supplies the schematic arrangement. To what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by experience ? To you all I say that the existence and destiny of our people depend less on external factors than on ourselves remaining faithful to the moral traditions which have enabled us to survive for thousands of years despite the heavy storms that have broken over our heads. To you, our English brethren, has now come the call to collaborate in the great work which has been inaugurated by celebrated men. To-day I salute with sincere emotion the supreme master of this method, who has delighted and educated us all.
To-day also there is an urge towards social progress, towards tolerance and freedom of thought, towards a larger political unity, which we to-day call Europe. To-day history has assigned to us the task of taking an active part in the economic and cultural reconstruction of our native land. To-day we can look back on these ten years with joy; for in that time the united energies of the Jewish people have accomplished a splendid piece of successful constructive work in Palestine, which certainly exceeds anything that we dared to hope then. To-day we look back at this state of affairs as at a lost paradise. Today I salute with sincere emotion the supreme master of this method, who has delighted-and edu?
Today also there is an urge toward social progress, toward tolerance and freedom of thought, toward a larger politica! Today everyone knows of course that the mentioned concepts contain nothing of the certainty, of the inherent necessity, which Kant had attributed to them. Today everyone knows, of course, that all attempts to clarify this paradox satisfactorily were condemned to failure as long as the axiom of the absolute charac- ter of time, viz,, of simultaneity, un- recognizedly was anchored in the unconscious. Today his discovery may be expressed as follows : Physical space and the ether are only dif- ferent terms for the same thing; fields are physical conditions of space. Today we have less ground than ever before for allowing ourselves to be forced away from this wonderful belief.
Today we know that no approach which is founded on classical mechanics and electrodynamics can yield a useful radiation formula. Today we look back at tbis state of affairs as at a lost para? Today's state of affairs had to be illuminated by these considerations, as they appear to me. Today, however, we regard the ether hypothesis as obsolete. Today, the questions which concern us are: how can we save mankind and its spiritual acquisitions of which we are the heirs? Together they determine the motion. Towards the beginning of the nineteenth century, the luminiferous ether came into prominence as a result of the brilliant successes of the wave theory in the hands of Young and Fresnel.

Translated from the orijjina] German by Mr. Satyendranath Bose.] Trouton and Noble, Trouton and Rankine, Rayleigh and Brace, and others employed a variety of different methods to detect the Lorentz- Fitzgerald contraction, but invariably with the same negative results. True enough, physics also was divided into separate fields, each of which was capable of devouring a short lifetime of work without having satis- fied the hunger for deeper knowledge. True, this is not a time when we can regard with satisfaction the results which honest striving on the ethical plane has achieved in these seventy-five years.

Try to imagine that there is only one body, forming our c.s., in the entire universe.

Turning to the theory of relativity itself, I am anxious to draw attention to the fact that this theory is not speculative in origin ; it owes its invention en- tirely to the desire to make physical theory fit ob- served fact as well as possible. Twenty-three centuries ago Democritus wrote : By convention sweet is sweet, by convention bitter is bitter, by convention hot is hot, by convention cold is cold, by convention colour is colour.
Two adjacent points represent two events, two happenings, at slightly different places and at slightly different instants. Two apparently unrelated branches of science are covered by the same theory. Two assumptions have been tried. Two clues laid down the rules of transla- tion. Two co- incident point-events correspond to the same value of the variables {.c^ x^ x^ -i'^) ; i.e., the coincidence is cha- racterised by the equality of the co-ordinates. Two distant points can be connected by a curve divided into steps as small as we wish. Two events happening at the same time in one c.s. Two events, i.e., the two light beams reaching the two walls, are simultaneous for the observer on the inside, but not for the observer on the outside.
Two expressions for energy occur in the mathematical description, each of which changes, although the sum does not vary. Two further consequences are: If the old laws follow from the new one when the gravitational forces are weak, deviations from Newton's law can only be expected for strong forces. Two further problems remained to be solved, however. Two men, A and J5, have covered lanterns and stand, say, at a distance of one mile from each other. Two neighbouring points P and P1 on the surface then correspond to the co-ordinates P: u,v P1: u + du, v + dv, where du and dv signify very small numbers. Two observers in two different c.s.
Two pinholes very near to each other, showing diffraction for ordinary light, would have to be many thousands of times smaller and closer together to show diffraction for X-rays. Two small spheres are given, both with an electric charge, that is, both carrying an excess of one electric fluid. Two solid objects may touch one another or be dis- tant from one another.

Unconditional obligation of all countries not merely to accept the decisions of the court of arbitration but also to give effect to them. Undaunted by the war and by difficulties of both a material and a psychological nature aroused by the war, these societies equipped two expeditions N to Sobral (Brazil), and to the island of Principe (West Africa) N and sent several of Britain's most celebrated astronomers (Eddington, Cottingham, Crommelin, Davidson), in order to obtain photographs of the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. Under a completely free economic system this fact is bound to lead to unemployment. Under a completely laissez-faire economie system, this fact is bound to lead to unemployment.

Under such conditions they have traversed the whole spherical space. Under the action of the internal friction of the liquid the vortex filaments in the inside of the cross section gradually get absorbed, their place being taken by new ones which form at the wall.

Under the influence of a radiation density q of frequency v, a molecule can make a transition from state Zn to state Zm by absorbing radiation energy ee, according to the probability law &W = B J g d*. Under the influence of this field, the embankment together with the earth moves non-uniformly in such a manner that their original velocity in the backwards direction is continuously reduced." Under these circumstances it does not seem superfluous to raise the question as to what extent the method of general relativity provides the possibility of accounting for atomic phenomena.
Under these conditions it is possible to choose .a function of 'l!J far an initial time t0 in such a manner that it vanishes outside of the region G0, and behaves, according to the Schrodinger equation, in such a manner that it retains this property-approximately at least-also for a later time, but with the region G0 having passed at that time t into another region G. In this manner one can, with a certain degree of approximation, speal<: of the motion of the region G as a whole, and one can approximate this motion by the motion of a point in the con:figuration-space.
Under these conditions the following can in fact be shown: We choose a recrion G0 in the configuration-space which, although large ( in eery dimension ) in relation to the wave length, is small in relation to the practical dimensions of the configura? Under these conditions there will exist, be? Under these conditions we understand by the " time " of an event the reading (position of the hands) of that one of these clocks which is in the immediate vicinity (in space) of the event. Under these conditions, the natural laws satisfying the demands of the (special) theory of relativity assume mathematical forms, in which the time co-ordinate plays exactly the same role as the three space co-ordinates.
Under this regime the Jews are the principal sufferers, not only because they are thwarted in their desire for free participation and in their striving for education, but also because most Jews find themselves particularly cramped in this spirit of narrow nationalism. Undisturbed, light travels with this speed through empty space. Unexpected adventures still await us. Unfortunately we cannot place ourselves between the sun and the earth, to prove there the exact validity of the law of inertia and to get a view of the rotating earth. Unfortunately, however, it compels one to use a continuum the number of whose dimensions is not that ascribed to space by physics hitherto (four) but rises indefinitely with the number of the particles constituting the system under consideration.
Unfortunately, the corollary also is true, namely, that better political insight has a hard time winning its way as long as there is little prospect of filling the stomach. Unfortunately, the universities of Europe to-day are for the most part the nurseries of chauvinism and of a blind intolerance of all things foreign to the particular nation or race, of all things bearing the stamp of a different individuality. Unfortunately, there are no indications that govemments yet realize that the situation in which mankind finds itself makes the adoption of revolutionary measures a compelling necessity.
Uniform motion can, however, never be realized; a stone thrown from a tower, a cart pushed along a road can never move absolutely uniformly be- cause we cannot eliminate the influence of external forces. Uniform relative motion of ether and matter could not be detected with the help of dynamical laws. Universal compensation is due to a change in local units of length and time, or rather, being merely different descriptions of the same reality, there is no compensation at all. Universal military training, Russian troops in Eastem Europe, United States contro} over the Pacific Islands, even the stiffening colonia} policies of the Netherlands, Great Britain and France, atomic and military secrecy-are all part of the old familiar jockeying for position.

Unless we can agree to limit the sovereignty of the individual State by all binding ourselves to take joint action against any country which openly or secretly resists a judgment of the Court of Arbitration, we shall never get out of a state of universal anarchy and terror. Unless you wish to use so drastic a measure, you must find a way of settling your disputes without resort to arms. Unlike the first, this latter statement need not of necessity hold a priori; it is not contained in the conceptions of " motion" and " reference-body " and derivable from them; only experience can decide as to its correctness or incorrectness. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor, and to that crippling of the social consciousness of individuals which I mentioned before.
Until it is definitely proved by experiment that light may be bent, I do not see any reason for not believing in the corpuscular theory, which seems to me to be simpler, and therefore better, than the wave theory. Until our day people learned to know each other only through the distorting mirror of their own daily press. Up to now our considerations have been referred to a particular body of reference, which we have styled a " railway embankment." Up to the present we have only considered events taking place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the function of a straight line. Up to the present, however, we have by no means maintained the equivalence of all bodies of reference K in connection with the formulation of natural laws.
Up to this point nothing particularly new or striking has appeared, and we may try to apply our previous ideas about potential differences. Upon giving up the hypothesis of the absolute character of time, particularly that of simultaneity, the four-dimensionality of the time-space concept was immediately recognized. Upon this depends the great advance in method which the theory of relativity owes to Minkowski. Upon this mechanical view was based the first naive theory of the electric fluids. Upon this simplifed foundation Lorentz based a complete g. A.

Using symbols, we may say that only the sum of (G) + (P) is subject to the control of experience. Using the example of the pulsating sphere, we may introduce two general physical concepts, important for the characterization of waves. Usually I work about four to six hours a day. V 1 q^ The notations (rV, ^\>) are to be understood in the sense that with the directions v, and every direction v perpendi- cular to V in the system {x, y, z) are always associated the directions with the same direction cosines in the system [x' y, z), A transformation which is accomplished by means of (10), (11), (12) with the condition 0<^<1 will be called a special Lorentz-transformation.

Various methods have been used to study the X-ray spectra, to deduce data concerning the wave- length from the diffraction pattern. Vectors and tensors are other forms of expression. Velocities greater than c, will not produce any effect. Velocities greater than that of light haveNas in our previous resultsNno possibility of existence. Velocity may be represented by an arrow or, briefly speaking, by a vector whose length in some chosen scale of units is a measure of the speed, and whose direction is that of the motion.
Verily the French nation has had to pay heavily for the victory of 1918; for that victory has been largely responsible for holding it down in the most degrading of all forms of slavery. Very few of such people have the opportunity during the most productive period of their lives to devote themselves undisturbed for any length of time to scientifc problems. Very often a seemingly perfect theory has proved inadequate in the light of further reading. Very often, however, it is impossible to patch up an old theory, and the difficulties result in its downfall and the rise of a new one. Very similar is the more important example of the revolution of the moon around the earth.
Vibrat- ing bodies, such as vocal cords and violin strings, are sources of sound waves which are propagated through the air in the manner explained for the pulsating sphere. Viewed from k the corresponding quantities are A, . Viewed from this angle, men like Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza are near to one another. Violence sometimes may have cleared away obstructions quickly, but it never has proved itself creative.

W Mayer has called our attention to the fact that one can make R'I~ and RI.~ into rational functions of the g,, and their first two derivatives by multiplying them by suitable powers of g. It is easy to show '. WE ALL KNOW, from what we experience with and within ourselves, that our conscious acts spring from our desires and our fears. WE ARE CAUGHT IN A SITUATION in which every citizen of every country, his children, and his life's work, are threatened by the terrible insecurity which reigns in our world today. WE HAVE COME HERE TODAY to defend the freedom of opinion guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, and also in defense of the freedom of teaching. WE SUMMARIZE: Again the rich variety of facts in the realm of atomic phenomena forces us to invent new physical concepts.
WE SUMMARIZE: In mechanics the future path of a moving body can be predicted and its past disclosed if its present condition and the forces acting upon it are known. WE SUMMARIZE: In the old theories of electric fluids, in the corpuscular and wave theories of light, we witness the further attempts to apply the mechanical view. WHAT I have here said is true only within a certain sense, just as a drawing consisting of a few strokes can do justice to a complicated object, full of perplexing details, only in a very limited sense. WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT in one's own existence one is hardly aware, and it certainly should not bother the other fellow. WHAT IS THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY?
War seems to me a mean, contemptible thing: I would rather be hacked in pieces than take part in such an abominable business. Was it not always thus and will it not always thus remain? Was it not ever thus and will it not ever thus remain? Was nature, in this case, merciful to the physicists attempting to understand all events from a mechanical point of view? Waves originating on one side of the ship will not be seen on the other. Waves spreading in a medium consisting of particles, with mechanical forces acting between them, are certainly a mechanical concept. Waves spreading on the surface of water are trans- verse. Wbat I value, on the other band, in the German politica!
Wbat can right-minded people, people who are proof against the emotional temptations of the moment, do to repair the dam? Wben this is done, the general principle of relativity does not indeed afford us a further lim.itation of possibilities ; but it makes us acquainted with the influence of the gravitational field on all processes, without our having to introduce any new hypothesis what? We The required condition of equilibrium is there- fore or RT av - K V + N ax-O The last equation states that equilibrium with the force K is brought about by osmotic pressure forces. We accustomed ourselves to the idea that electrons are particles, elementary quanta of electricity and matter. We achieve this through a repeated application of the following simple law.
We again see the dark and light rings so characteristic of the wave theory. We aim at creating a people of workers, at creating the Jewish village in the first place, and we desire that the treasures of culture should be accessible to our laboring class, especially since Jews in all circum stances, as we know, place education above all things. We all are ruled in what we do by impulses; and these impulses are so organized that our actions in genera!serve for our self-preservation and that of the race. We all feel that the free play of economic forces, the unregulated and unrestrained pursuit of wealth and power by the individual, no longer leads automatically to a tolerable solution of these problems.
We all know that power politics, sooner or later, necessarily leads 'iO war, and that war, under present circum? We all know that when a war comes, every man accepts the duty to commit a for his own country. We all know that, so why complain? We all try to escape pain and death, while we seek what is pleasant. We already know from our previous discussion that the behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks is influenced by gravitational fields, i.e. We already know that an induced current appears if the number of lines of force, passing the sur- face bounded by the wire, changes. We already know that in the simple case of one or many particles we can rise from the classical to the quantum description, from the objective description of events in space and time to probability waves.
We already know that it is necessary to have a body of reference for the measurement of a distance, with respect to which body the distance can be measured up. We already know the laws for this inertial c.s. We also remark that when A B is an invariant for every choice of the tensor B , then A has a tensorial character. We also remember that the equality of the two masses, gravitational and inertial, was quite accidental from the point of view of classical mechanics and played no role in its structure. We also saw how the mechanical point of view was applied to the kinetic theory of matter.
We always prefer to leave off the second group to itself, and w^ith a lisht heart conclude that we can never decide from physical considerations whether the si)ace, which is supposed to be APPENDIX 71 at rest, may not finally t>e in uniform motion. We anticipate here the possibility that the mass increased with the ab? We are accustomed further to regard three points as being situated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be made to coincide for observation with one eye, under suitable choice of our place of observation. We are accustomed to look upon the axioms of geometry as settled once for all, while we seldom have the same amount of conviction regarding the axioms of mecha- nics, and therefore the two invariants are seldom mentioned in the same breath.
We are accustomed to regard as real those sense perceptions which are common to different individuals, and which therefore are, in a measure, impersonal. We are acquainted with space-time domains which behave (approximately) in a " Galileian " fashion under suitable choice of reference-body, i.e. We are all conscious of what we owe to Arnold Berliner. We are already so accustomed to introduce new substances, if necessary for a mechanical explanation, that we can do it once more without any great hesitation. We are assembled to-day to take stock of ourselves. We are assembled today to take stock of ouTselves. We are chiefly concerned with the pro- blem of the direction of the force acting upon a pole.
We are concerned not merely with the technical problem of securing and maintaining peace, but also with the impor? We are concerned only with pioneer work in science, which consists of finding new and unex- pected paths of development ; with the adventures in scientific thought which create an ever-changing pic- ture of the universe. We are concerned with the eternal antithesis between the two insep- arable components of our knowledge, the empirical and the rational, in our department. We are crossing into barbarism. We are crossing the seas by power and utilize power also in order to relieve humanity from ali tiring muscular work.
We are forced to regard the kinetic energy of a molecule as a measure of the temperature of the gas if we wish to form a consistent mechanical picture of matter. We are forced to the belief that both sorts of field must correspond to verified structure of space. We are happy and fortunate to have such men from the Gentile world among us to-night; their presence lends an added solemnity to this memorable evening. We are here to take counsel with each other. We are indebted to the Royal Society and to the Royal Astronomical Society for the investigation of this important deduction. We are not, of course, allowed to assume that all the electrons pass through one of the holes.
We are now in a position to formulate more exactly the idea of Minkowski, which was only vaguely indicated in Section 17. We are now in a position to replace the pro. We are now using many synchronized clocks instead of only one and can, therefore, easily judge whether or not two distant events are simultaneous in a given c.s. We are only to make such sacrifices to the State as will promote the free development of individual human beings. We are sitting in a closed room so isolated from the external world that no air can enter or escape.
We are so accustomed today to the creation of con- cepts corresponding to differential quotients that we can now hardly grasp any longer what a remarkable power of abstraction it needed to reach the general differential law by a double crossing of frontiers, in the course of which the concept of mass had in addi- tion to be invented. We are still far from exhausting the conse- quences of this valuable clue to the puzzle of motion. We are strong and safe and in no hurry to mix ourselves up in other people's affairs." We are therefore dealing with a solution of the (new) field equations, which is free from singularities for all finite points.
We are therefore led to the conception that the general laws of motion which determine specially the forms of S^ and Sg must be of such a kind, that the mechanical behaviour of S^ and S^ must be essentially conditioned by the distant masses, which we had not brought into the system considered. We are therefore not in a position to define exactly the co-ordinates x, y, z relative to the disc by means of the method used in discussing the special theory, and as long as the co- ordinates and times of events have not been defined, we cannot assign an exact meaning to the natural laws in which these occur. We are thus forced to conclude that the quantum-mechanical descrip- tion of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete.
We are thus led also to a definition of " time " in physics. We are thus led to the field theory of electricity, and, Iater on to the attempt to base physics entirely upon the concept of the field ( after an attempted compromise with classica!mechanics ). We are unjust in attempting to ascribe tbe increasing superiority of American research work exclusively to superior wealth; devotion, patience, a spirit of comradeship, and a talent for cooperation play an important part in its successes. We are unjust in attempting to ascribe the increasing superiority of American research-work exclusively to superior wealth; zeal, patience, a spirit of comradeship, and a talent for co-operation play an important part in its successes.
We arrive at a closet approximation to reality by considering the case where the g,,.. differ from the values of (4) by quantities which are small compared with 1, and neglecting small quantities of second and higher order. We arrive at a much more practical determination along the following line of thought. We arrive at such a space, for example, in the following way. We arrived at a similar conclusion in Section 13 in connection with the experiment of Fizeau, the result of which is foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity of drawing on hypotheses as to the physical nature of the liquid. We ask : if we determine the ratio of two masses in both ways described above, do we obtain the same re- sult?
We ask the question: besides the Cartesian co-ordinates which we have used are there other equivalent co-ordinates? We ask: how is it possible to increase this distance? We asked before : what is light? We assign to every point of the continuum (event) four numbers, x1, x2, x3, x4 (coordinates), which have not the least direct physical significance, but only serve the purpose of numbering the points of the continuum in a definite but arbitrary manner. We assume firstly, that in a certain four-dimensional region considered, the special relativity theory is true for some particular choice of co-ordinates. We assume that the length of the mercury column increases in proportion to the increase in temperature.
We assume that this definition of synchronism is free from contradictions, and possible for any number of points; and that the following relations are universally valid: 1) If the clock at B synchronizes with the clock at A, the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B. We assume, therefore, the existence of one c.s. We bave now deduced the generai lawEI' which are satisfied by the gravitational field and matter, by consistently using a system of co-ordnates for whch ,.,/ = 1. We bave to take it that the general laws of motion, wbich in particular determine the shapes of 81 and 82 , must be such that the mechanical behaviour of 81 and 82 is partly con? We become indifferent to the fate of the individual gas particles. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.
We both felt that this friendship was not only a blessing because each understood the other, was enriched by him, and found ins him that responsive echo so essential to anybody who is truly alive; it also helped to make both of us more independent of external experience, to objectivize it more easily. We bring them into contact and free them from all other external in- fluences. We but rarely reflect how relatively small as compared vvith the powerf ul influence of tradition is the in? We calculate the radius of curvature R of the path, where the only deflecting force is a magnetic force N acting perpendicular to the velocity of projection. We call A the extension of the tensor A . We call Bv the reduced tensor associated with Ava Similarly, B" = g"ga.13A...
We call Bv the reduced tensor associated with Ava Similarly, B" = g"ga.13A... We call Bv the reduced tensor associated with Ava Similarly, B" = g"ga.13A... We call four quantities A as the components of a co- variant four-vector, when for any choice of the contra- variant four vector B (6) > A B = Invariant. We call four quantities A as the components of a co- variant four-vector, when for any choice of the contra- variant four vector B (6) > A B = Invariant. We call him good or bad accord? We call him good or bad according to how he stands in this matter. We call it the " fundamental tensor." We call it the " fundamental tensor/^ Afterwards we shall deduce some properties of this tensor, which will also be true for any tensor of the second rank.
We call its motion a uniform translation ("uniform" because it is of constant velocity and direction, " translation " because although the carriage changes its position relative to the embankment yet it does not rotate in so doing). We call such a con- nection between the two sheets a "bridge. " We call such a system of thought a theory. We call the bound electrons OoscillatorsO: they emit and absorb electromagnetic waves of definite periods.
We call the coordinates, measured in the system K0, x0, y0, z0, and by a twofold application of our equations of transformation we obtain Since the relations between x0, y0, z0 and x, y, z do not contain the time t, the systems K and K0 are at rest with respect to one another, and it is clear that the transformation from K to K0 must be the identical transformation. We call the directions thus related to each other parallel. We call the magnitude ds the " distance " apart of the two events or four-dimensional points. We call the tensor Av the " extension " (covariant derivative) of the tensor A,,, In the first place we ca!l readily show that the operation leads to a tensor, even if the vector A,,.
We call these two numbers the co-ordinates of the surface of the table (Gaussian co-ordinates). We call x the components of the energy of matter, t the components of the energy of the gravitational field. We called these " Galileian co-ordinate systems." We can again introduce the indices 1, 2, 8, 4, so that we write (^/, ^^2? We can also conclude that the coefficients b? We can also define a tensor of the second rank of the type (12) a' =AB'' which is co-variant with reference to ^ and contravariant with reference to v. Its transformation law is (13) a" = -s- a- ^ Naturally there are mixed tensors with any number of co-variant indices, and with any number of contra- variant indices.
We can also determine the corresponding values of the time by the observation of encounters of the body with clocks, in conjunction with the observation of the encounter of the hands of clocks with particular points on the dials. We can always proceed on the assumption that it does remain true. We can approach the idea of space in a corresponding manner, though some may regard the attempt as rather fantastical. We can approach this same difficulty from a different point of view. We can as- sume either of the two possibilities, or that the flow is simultaneous in both directions. We can assume that this approximation should lead to Newton's theory.
We can assume the existence of an ether; but we must abstain from ascribing a definite state of motion to it, i.e., we must divest it by abstraction of the last mechanical characteristic which Lorentz left it. We can at least indicate a c.s. We can attain to a more practicable result bv the following- treatment. We can attempt to pattern a theory of magnetism after the theory of electric fluids. We can best explain this by the example with which we are now dealing. We can calculate the coefficient of diffusion from the two conditions (I) and (2) found for the dynamic equilibrium.
We can calculate the speed of the car at any moment if we know how high it happens to be above the ground, but we omit this point here because of its quantitative character which can best be expressed by mathematical formulae. We can characterise the Lorentz transformation still more simply if we introduce the imaginary in place of t, as time-variable. We can compare the debit and credit entries in his ledger to the two kinds of electric fluids. We can continue body A in such a way that it comes into contact with any other body, X. We can continue to use our straightforward method of reasoning. We can deduce what happens here from that which happened far away by the summation of these very small steps.
We can detect a difference in electric potential between the copper in the first glass and the zinc in the last by means of a fairly sensitive electroscope if the number of the "elements 55 , that is, glasses with plates, constituting the battery, is sufficiently large. We can distinguish various kinds of theories in physics. We can do this in two different ways. We can draw some further conclusions from the theory of sound as a wave propagated through a ma- terial medium. We can easily calculate the mass ofone such hydrogen molecule by dividing i by the number quoted above. We can easily see that, with reference to the co-ordinate system, the rays of light must appear curved in ease y 's are not constants.
We can equally well imagine a moving clock having a different rhythm from one at rest. We can express this as follows: The magnitude ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c2dt2, which belongs to two adjacent points of the four-dimensional space-time continuum, has the same value for all selected (Galileian) reference-bodies. We can fitly call this operation a mixed one ; for it is outer with reference to the indices ju, and t, and inner with respect to the indices v and q-. We can foretell approximately how many atoms will disintegrate during the next half-hour, but we cannot say, even in our theoretical descrip- tions, why just these particular atoms are doomed. We can form a static picture, considering the curve in the two-dimensional time-space continuum.
We can form an idea of the invariant character of the expression for natural laws for tlie group-transformation G^ in the following manner. We can form new bodies by bringing bodies B, C, . We can formulate this fact more abstractly: the velocity of a moving material point, relative to the lower c.s., is equal to that relative to the upper c.s. We can fuse both these concepts into a single one by thinking of a Cartesian system of co-ordinates as a cubical frame-work formed of rods each of unit length. We can hardly avoid making the assumption that in all other cases, also, the space distribution of energy is given by a symmetrical tensor, T?, and that this complete energy tensor everywhere satisfies the relation (47c).
We can hardly expect a negative length if the velocity is greater than that of light. We can imagine innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose, without our being able to state a reason why one of them is to be preferred to the others ; for any one of these laws would be founded just as little on more general theoretical principles as is the law of Newton. We can indeed see from Newton's formulation of it that the concept of absolute space, which comprised that of absolute rest, made him feel uncomfortable; he realized that there seemed to be nothing in ex- perience corresponding to this last concept. We can leam from them too how this problem can be solved by the method of organization. We can likewise determine the kinetic ener?
We can look upon the dynamic equilibrium condition con- sidered here as a superposition of two processes proceeding in opposite directions, namely i- I. We can not count on the prestige or strength of any single nation to bring about international stability. We can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing, which we brought forward against the general principle of relativity at theend of Section 18. We can now enumerate the characteristics of the motion of the electrons available for experimental verifica- tion, which follow from equations A). We can now legitimately ask as to the "truth" of geometrical propositions interpreted in this way, since we are justified in asking whether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have associated with the geometrical ideas.
We can now return to our quantum problem. We can now say: light stripes appear where many electrons fall. We can only conclude that the special theory of relativity cannot claim an unlinlited domain of validity ; its results hold only so long as we are able to disregard the influences of gravitational fields on the phenomena (e.g. We can only foretell the chance, the probability, that it will behave in some particular manner. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals with things called "straight lines," to each of which is ascribed the property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it. We can only see the universe by the impressions of our senses reflecting indirectly the things of reality. We can only surmise "what would happen if.
We can predict the posi- tion, at any time, of a stone thrown from a tower, and confirm our prediction by observation. We can put w and a = tan~^ - . We can regard Minkowski's " world " in a formal manner as a four-dimensional Euclidean space (with an imaginary time coordinate) ; the Lorentz transformation corresponds to a " rotation " of the co-ordinate system in the fourdimensional " world." We can represent this fact in a new way, and shall do so even though it is difficult to understand the advan- tage of this. We can say, without trying to be too rigorous, that there is no essential difference between a part of a plane and a part of a sphere whose radius is sufficiently large. We can see through an empty glass vessel if we extract the air from it.
We can specially measure up the area (F) of this surface by means of a square made up of measuring-rods. We can state this general principle of relativity in still another form, which renders it yet more clearly intelligible than it is when in the form of the natural extension of the special principle of relativity. We can still apply the old theory, whenever facts within the region of its validity are in- vestigated. We can sum this up as follows: Gauss invented a method for the mathematical treatment of continua in general, in which " size-relations " (" distances " between neighbouring points) are defined. We can suppose that all such curves are given when the vahie of its co-ordinates x^ are siven in terms of \.
We can then calculate with the help of Schrodinger's equation the state of the combined system I+II at any subsequent time; in par- ticular, for any t) T. Let us designate the cor- responding wave function by +. We can therefore always regard an infinitesimally small region of the space-time continuum as Galilean. We can therefore say, that this surface always encloses the same light-complex. We can think of force even without picturing a horse pulling a car- riage ! We can think of no cause for this preference for definite states of motion to all others, according to our previous considerations, either in the perceptible bodies or in the concept of motion; on the contrary, it must be regarded as an independent property of the space-time continuum.
We can thus as a rough approximation arrive at a conclusion as to the nature of the universe as a whole, if we treat the matter as being at rest. We can thus get the meaning of the concept of a vector without referring to a geometrical representation. We can thus signify this motion as one under the influence of a gravitation field. We can try to generalize the old concepts of velocity, change of velocity, and force for the case of motion along a curved path. We can understand, therefore, that a quantitative study of Brownian movement can give us deeper insight into the kinetic theory of matter. We can well imagine that a moving clock changes its rhythm, so long as the law of this change is the same for all inertial c.s.
We can well imagine that not only does the moving clock change its rhythm, but also that a moving stick changes its length, so long as the laws of the changes are the same for all inertial c.s. We can, however, always imagine the magnetic needle of such length that only the force acting upon the pole nearer the current has to be taken into account. We can, however, attempt to visualize the ac- tions just as we did in the case of a gravitational force. We can, however, maintain on the strength of the relativistic equations of gravitation that spaces of cosmic proportions must depart from Euclidean be- havior if there is a positive mean density of matter, however small, in the Universe.
We can, however, use some very simple arguments which, though they do not prove that the velocity of light is independent of the motion of the source, nevertheless make this fact convincing and un- derstandable. We can, nevertheless, well imagine having done it in this, or in some similar way, based upon the application of the law of inertia. We can, therefore, always transform not only positions, but also velocities from one c.s. We can, therefore, say that classical mechanics postulates a covariance of Physical laws for the group of homogeneous linear transformations of the expression _a;_2/2 -s+r^ ... ... (1) when (?=qo. We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line goes through two points. We cannot build physics on the matter concept alone.
We cannot combine (1), (2), and (3). We cannot despair of humanity, since we are ourselves human beings. We cannot do better than quote Eddiugton's descrip- tion of this famous experiment. " We cannot even be sure that it has a final solution. We cannot foretell the course of one single electron, but we can predict that, in the net result, the light and dark stripes will appear on the screen. We cannot give a mechanical explanation of ether. We cannot picture the journey of a photon or electron in the way we imagined motion in classical mechanics. We cannot shoot out single photons or electrons at given instants, like bullets from a gun. We cannot show here how abundant and fruitful the consequences of this generalization have proved.
We cannot similarly introduce in K' a time corresponding to physical requirements, which will be shown by all similarly prepared clocks at rest relative to the system K'. We cannot talk about absolute uniform motion because of the Galilean relativity principle. We cannot treat them separately and describe each of them through a probability wave in three dimensions, just because of their mutual inter- 306 THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS action. We care nothing for individuals. We come now to a train of thought which plays an analogous role in the theories of special and general relativity. We conclude: an external force is act- ing in the direction of the motion. We confine ourselves to the case of the extension of the tensors of the 2nd rank for which the law of for- mation can be clearly seen.
We consider a free object at rest that emits the same amount of radiative energy in two opposing directions. We consider a number (n) of movable points (e.g., molecules) confined in a volume v0. We consider next the equations of motion of a continuous medium. We consider, finally, Maxwell's equations in the form which are the foundation of the electron theory of Lorentz. We correspondingly introduce the following quantum-theoretical hypothesis. We could argue: a photon passes through either one of the two pinholes. We could expect the screen to appear light if the photon passes through and dark if it does not. We could guess a further link in the chain of our analogy: electron moving uniformly -> waves of a definite length.
We could imagine the still more complicated possibility that the ether is only partially carried by the room moving with its light source. We could move the small solenoid, as we previously moved the bar magnet, creating an induced current in the larger solenoid. We could never use a scale if the earth did not attract bodies, if gravity did not exist. We could only expect disagreement between experiment and the classical transformation with velocities approaching that of light. We could reason: assume, for a moment, that the field characterizes all actions determined by its sources in a unique way. We could represent the five pairs of numbers in the "timetable" as five points on a surface. We could represent the knowledge gained from our "timetable" in a different way.
We could say more : it is hardly possible to imagine such experiments per- formed as accidental play, without the pre-existence of more or less definite ideas about their meaning. We could see occurrences from the past by reaching pre- viously sent light waves. We could try to account for it as follows : perhaps there is some interaction between the rim of the hole and the photon which is responsible for the appearance of the diffraction rings. We could try, as we did with the laws of motion, to generalize the gravitational law to make it fit the special relativity theory, or, in other words, to formulate it so that it would be invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation and not to the classical one.
We couldn't explain all phenomena assuming simple forces between unalterable particles. We denote this velocity by the symbol W, and we then obtain, as in Section 6, W=v+w A) But we can carry out this consideration just as well on the basis of the theory of relativity. We designate four quantities, which are defined as functions of the x? We designate this operation, whose uniqueness will appear in the sequel, the parallel displacement of the vector A from P1, to the infinitesimally near point P2. We did not state^for which c.s. We direct our attention to the world-point ^, y, z, t, and suppose that we are in a position to recognise this substantial point at any subsequent time. We do it by weighing on a scale.
We do know, indeed, that electricity consists of elementary particles (electrons, positive nuclei), but from a theoretical point of view we cannot comprehend this. We do not ask "What are the laws of nature which are co? We do not intend, however, to discuss the gravita- tional problem just now It served only as an introduc- tion, simplifying the explanation of similar methods of reasoning in the theory of electricity. We do not know of the existence of other planetary systems similar to ours. We do not know the energy factors which determine the distribution of electricity in particles of definite size and charge, and all attempts to complete the theory in this direction have failed.
We do not know whether The multitude of layers discussed or not this ambition will ever result in a above corresponds to the several stages of progress which have resulted from the definitive system. We do not know whether or ot this ambition will ever result in a definite system. We do not know why individual electrons choose particular holes, but the net result of repeated experiments must be that both pinholes par- ticipate in transmitting the electrons from the source to the screen. We do not know, of course, if the sages of the past have really asked themselves this question, consciously and in this form; but we do know how they bave tried to solve the problem. We do not mix time and space, using a dynamic picture in which positions change with time.
We do not seek those laws of nature which are co-variants with regard to the tranformations having the determinant 1, but we ask : what are the general co-variant laws of nature ? We do not yet know with certainty, by what mathematical mechanism the total field in space is to be described and what the generai inva:riant laws are to which this total feld is subject. We do this in spite of the fact that we perceive tempora!alterations in it. We drew points along a definite path showing the exact positions of the body at certain instants and then tangent vectors showing the direction and magnitude of the velocities. We ean easily convince ourselves that this vanishes identically.
We easily recognize tbat the course of the light-rays must be bent with regard to the system of co-ordinates, if the g,.. are not con? We eat food that others have grow, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built. We eat food that others have produced, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built. We encounter the same difficulty with all physical statements in which the conception " simultaneous " plays a part. We envisage a rigid sphere6 of radius R, at rest relatively to the moving system k, and with its centre at the origin of co-ordinates of k. The equation of the surface of this sphere moving relatively to the system K with velocity v is ?2 + ?2 + ?2 = R2.

We expand the Z component of the electrical force (Z) at an arbitrary point during the time interval between t = 0 and t = T in a Fourier series in which A? We expand the Z component of the electrical force (Z) at an arbitrary point during the time interval between t = 0 and t = T in a Fourier series in which A? We express this property of the surface by describing the latter as a continuum. We feel it painfully in our fate.
We feel that such questions are meaningf ul because in all discussions SCIENCE SEARCHES FOR RELATIONS which are though to exist independently of the searching individuai. We finally infer that boundary conditions in spatial infinity fall away altogether, because the universal continuum in respect of i ts spatial dirnensions is to be viewed as a self-contained continuum of finite spatial (three-dimensional) volume. We find it simpler to say just what this book does not intend to be. We find the conclusions, at which we arrived by following our initial clues, realized in the motion of a thrown stone, in the motion of the moon, the earth, and the planets. We first have to show that the form (47a) is equivalent to the equations (47).
We fit to the world our space-time variables 13 98 PEINCIPLE OF ELLATIVITY (^1 '^8 '"s '^4) such that to any and every point-event^ corresponds a system of values of (tj r^ ,(3 .c^). We form the inner product " = F...JJJ. We found him interested in physical and philosophical ideas and we were forced to admire the patience with which he struggled through the less interesting and more difficult passages. We found that the mathematical methods for solving problem (i) lay ready to our hands in the infinitesimal differential calculus of Ricci and Levi-Civita. We further imagine that there are two observers at the two watches, and moving with them, and that these observers apply the criterion for synchronism to the two clocks.
We fust transform the field equations (7) of gravitation by mixed multiplication by g"'"a We then obtain (by inter? We gain an understanding of the laws of nature by analysing the simplest cases and by leaving out of our first attempts all intricate complications. We get RT I D= N 61rkP * The coefficient of diffusion of the suspended sub- stance therefore depends (except for universal constants and thk absolute temperature) only on the coefficient of viscosity of the liquid and on the size of the suspended particles.
We get for example, out of the mixed tensor of the fourth rank A , the mixed tensor of the second rank A =A =(SA ) /5 a^ V^ a/3/ and from it again by '* reduction " the tensor of the zero rank A= A = A The proof that the result of reduction retains a truly tensorial character, follows either from the representation GENERALISED THEORY OF RELATIVITY 109 of tensor according to the generalisation of (12) in combi- nation with (6) or out of the generalisation of (13). We get one important approximation if we consider the case when (I 's differ from (4) onlv bv small masrnitudes (com- pared to 1) where we can neglect small quantities of the second and higher orders (first aspect of the approxima- tion.)
We get the equations of the material phenomena completely when the latter is characterised by four other differential equations independent of one another. We give our attention to that part of the axis of Y of system k which lies between ? We give our attention to the motion of a. materiai point in accordance with the equations (16). We had a current flowing through a wire circuit in the form of a circle. We had already considered the right field- equation for gravitation for two years before the pL)lication of the general theory of relativity, but we were unable to see how they could be used in physics.
We had confidently expected that one who had belonged to our Academy for so long would have ranged himself, irrespective of his own political sympathies, on the side of the defenders of our nation against the flood of lies which has been let loose upon it. We had him making up for a complete lack of any concrete knowledge of physics and mathematics by quite a great number of virtues. We had previously the idealized experiments with a uniformly moving room. We had to have small obstacles or small apertures. We had to imagine, previously, the magnetic field of a current existing without the testing pole.
We have (<^ <^^)=<^y, c^*, + ... = NOTES 177 The general six-veetor / is composed fmm the A^ectors ff>f(f)^ in the followinoj wa>y : p and p'^ denotins^ the contents of the pieoos oP mutually perpendicular planes composing f.

We have H. Hertz to thank for definitely freeing the conception of the field from all encumbrances derived from the conceptual armory of mechanics, and H. A. Lorentz for freeing it from a material substratum ; according to the latter the only thing left to act as a substratum for the field was physical, empty space (or ether), which even in the mechanics of Newton had not been destitute of all physical functions. We have a closed wire without any source of current.
We have a general relativistic theory of macroscopic phenomena, which however has hitherto been unable to account for the atomic structure of matter and for quantum effects, and we have a quantum theory, which is able to account satisfactorily for a large number of atomic and quantum phenomena but which by its very nature is unsuited to the principle of relativity. We have a light beam travelling through a vacuum and falling on a glass plate. We have a vessel closed by a piston which can move freely. We have all seen the waves that spread in wider and wider circles when a stone is thrown into a pool of water. We have all suffered under this evi , without making any effort to mitigate it. We have all suffered under this evil, without making any effort to mitigate it.
We have all the more justification for this assumption as (46) contains only first derivatives of the g,,., between which even in the special case of the existence of K0 , no relations sub? We have already learned about the achievements of Newton's theory, about the great development of astronomy based upon his gravitational law. We have already mentioned several times that the special relativity theory is to be looked upon as a special case of the s^eneral, in which a ^s have constant values (4). We have already recognized the similarity between an oscillating cord, the membrane of a drum, a wind instrument, or any other acoustical instrument on the one hand, and a radiating atom on the other. We have already remarked in Section 5 that all attempts of this nature led to a negative result.
We have already seen, from Oersted's experiment, how a magnetic field coils itself around a changing electric field. We have already stated several times that classical mechanics starts out from the following law: Material particles sufficiently far removed from other material particles continue to move uniformly in a straight line or continue in a state of rest. We have already tried to change (1) and (2) and came to a disagreement with experiment. We have also repeatedly emphasised that this fundamental law can only be valid for bodies of reference K which possess certain unique states of motion, and which are in uniform translational motion relative to each other. We have also successfully stood the severe test to which the events of the last few years have subjected us.
We have an instance of this in the theory of relativity. We have another instance of far-reaching agreement between the deductions from two theories in Newtonian mechanics on the one hand, and the general theory of relativity on the other. We have ascertained that inductive physics asks questions of deductive, and vice versa, to answer which demands the exertion of all our energies. We have assumed that the single particles are all referred to the same Co-ordinate system. We have at least one indication, though a very weak one, of how to build the new physics. We have been making use of two concepts which play principal roles in classical mechanics: force and change of velocity.
We have changed this to "Times Square, New York", as this is the most well known/identifiable location to English speakers in the present day. We have deduced the kinematics corresponding to our two fundamental principles for the laws necessary for us, and we shall now pass over to their application in electro- dynamics. We have denoted the four-vector w by the matrix I (o^ oi,2 <^i w^ [ . We have described two events happening at the same time in one c.s., but at different times in another c.s. We have drawn three subsequent positions of the two c.s. We have emerged from a war in which we had to accept the degradingly low ethical standards of the enemy.
We have every reason to be gratef ul to our French and Polish colleagues whose initiative has assembled us here for a momentous objective: to use the inHuence of wise men promoting peace and security throughout the world. We have examples of this in : 1) the alternatint^ matrix /", which corresponds to the space-time vector of the II kind, 2) the product /F of two such matrices_, for by a transfor- mation A, it is replaced by (A-^A- A-^FA) = A-y F A, 8) further when (w^. We have experience of such rapid motions only in the case of electrons and ions; for other motions the variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too small to make themselves evident in practice.
We have far less success in picturing to ourselves relations in this fourdimensional continuum than in the three-dimensional Euclidean continuum; but it must be emphasized that even in the Euclidean three-dimensional geometry its concepts and relations are only of an abstract nature in our minds, and are not at all identical with the images we form visually and through our sense of touch. We have followed the initial clues leading to the laws of motion. We have had to forsake the description of individual cases as objective happenings in space and time; we have had to introduce laws of a statistical nature. We have here an opportunity of showing what we have learnt in the thousands of years of our martyrdom.
We have here no revolutionary act but the natural continuation of a line that can be traced through centuries. We have hitherto an A-time, and a B-time, but no time common to A and B. We have identical forces acting on two resting masses. We have just seen that in the case of freely moving bodies such interactions must be assumed not to exist. We have laws, but do not know what frame to refer them to, and our whole physical structure seems to be built on sand. We have learned something about the laws of nature, their invariance with respect to the Lorentz transformation, and their validity for all inertial systems moving uniformly, relative to each other. We have learned to fly and we are able to send messages and news without any difficulty over the entire world through electric waves.
We have no time to spend in this way. We have not defined a common time for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we establish by definition that the time required by light to travel from A to B equals the OtimeO it requires to travel from B to A. We have not one light substance but many, each belonging to a different colour. We have not written a textbook of physics. We have now assigned to reason and experience their place within the system of theoretical physics. We have now completed the arguments which provide a strong support for the hypotheses stated in 2, concerning the interaction between matter and radiation by means of absorption and emission processes, or in- or outgoing radiation.
We have now deduced the most general laws which the o'ravitation-field and matter satisfv when we use a co-ordinate system for which \/ g = 1. We have now deduced the requisite laws of the theory of kinematics corresponding to our two principles, and we proceed to show their application to electrodynamics. We have now revealed the causes of the forma- tion of meanders. We have now to show, that every ray of light moves in the moving system with a velocity c (when measured in the moving system), in case, as we have actually assumed, c is also the velocity in the stationary system ; for we have not as yet adduced any proof in support of the assump- tion that the j)rincip]e of relativity is reconcilable with the principle of constant light-velocity.
We have now traced the history of the development of the restricted or special theory of Relativity, which is mainly concerned with optical and electrical phenomena. We have only one "mysterious" substance instead of an infinite number of them corresponding to the great number of colours in the spectrum. We have only to move a two-foot rule about on the plane E to convince ourselves that the shadows constantly increase in size as they move away from S on the plane towards infinity. We have only to move a two-foot rule about on the plane E to convince ourselves that the shadows constantly increase in size as they move away from S on the plane towards infinity." We have penetrated far less deeply into the regularities ob?
We have penetrated far less deeply into the regularities obtaining within the realm of living things, but deeply enough nevertheless to sense at least the rule of :6.xed necessity. We have recounted in the introduction how out of the chaos and disorder into which the electrodynamics and optics of moving bodies had fallen previous to 1895, Lorentz, Einstein and Minkowski have succeeded in building up a consistent, and fruitful new theory of Time and Space. We have seen before that the general relativity-postu- late leads to the condition that the system of equations for Physics, must be C9- variants for any possible substitu- tion of co-ordinates .<,, ... j^ ; we have now to see how such general co-variant equations can be obtained.
We have seen in classical physics that if we know the position and velocity of a material point at a certain instant and the forces acting upon it, we can predict its future path. We have seen new realities created by the advance of physics. We have seen that Einstein's theory requires local curvature of space-time in the neighbourhood of matter. We have seen that a potential difference between two conductors can be quickly nullified by connecting them with a wire, so that there is a flow of electric fluid from one conductor to the other. We have seen that both parts of the beam are situated in free ether ; no material meduim is involved in any portion of the paths actually traversed by the beam.
We have seen that in pre-relativity physics, in order to specify relations in space, a body of reference, or a space of reference, is required, and, in addition, a Cartesian system of co-ordinates. We have seen that its velocity increases as it falls, but we should like to know much more. We have seen that the corpuscular theory explains many of the observed facts. We have seen that the substance theory explains many of the heat phenomena. We have seen that there is no force between the pole of one magnet and the middle of the other. We have seen that this law of inertia cannot be THE RISE OF THE MECHANICAL VIEW 9 derived directly from experiment, but only by specula- tive thinking consistent with observation.
We have seen that vectors representing force and change in velocity for any short interval of time have the same direction, but we must follow Newton one step farther and assume a simple relation between their lengths. We have seen the possibility of adapting the me- chanical view to a description of the elementary facts of electrostatics. We have seen, from Faraday's experiment, how an electric field coils itself around a changing magnetic field. We have so far defined only an OA timeO and a time. We have something like this in the electromagnetic field. We have still to investigate the , amplitude of the waves, which occur in these equations. We have the laws but do not know the frame to which to refer them.
We have the right to regard the field as something much more than we did at first. We have then a system of u-curves, and this "infinitely dense" system covers the whole surface of the table. We have thereby achieved a considerable simplification of formulre and calculations, wthout failing to comply with the require? We have therefore as the first result : The differential equations expressing the fundamental equations of electrodynamics for moving bodies, when written in p and the vectors C, ^, in, E, M, are exactl}^ of the same form as the equations for moving bodies. We have therefore come to tbis result : from tbe covariant tensor of tbe first rank A - cp " - x,.. we can, by differentiation, form a covariant tensor of the second rank A,.. = A,,, - { .v , r}A, .
We have therefore to introduce in our generalised theory energy-tensor t"' associated with matter, which like the energy components t _ of the gravitation-field (equations 49, and oO"! We have therefore two different concepts and two conservation laws. We have thus assigned to pure reason and ex- perience their places in a theoretical system of physics. We have thus created a transverse wave. We have thus derived the Lorentz transformation. We have thus discovered some similarity between the oscillating cord and the atom emitting radiation. We have thus good grounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a result we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity.
We have thus got the result that out of the co-variant tensor of the first rank A = 5-^ we can get by differentiation a co-variant tensor of 2nd rank (26) A ixv dA ( ixv 16 1^-^ PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY We call the tensor A the *' extension " of the tensor A . We have thus proved that J is independent both of V* and of x,, yr, . We have to add and sub- tract the distance between the origins of two c.s. We have to consider the lines of force cutting that part of the plane which has the wire for a rim. We have to deal, however, be attained to a very high degree.
We have to deal, however, with the science of today, in which these strata represent problematic partial successes which support one another but which also threaten one another, because today's systems of concepts contain deep seated in? We have to descend one floor, to return for a moment to classical physics. We have to distinguish between two things bere-real over-production and apparent over-production. We have to distinguish between two things here realover-production and apparent over-production.
We have to fake into consideration thefact that those of our conceptions^ in lohich time plays a part, are alioays conceptions of synchronism For example, we say that a train arrives here at 7 o'clock ; this means that the exact pointing of the little hand of my watch to 7, and the arrival of the train are synchronous events. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a point on the non-rigid reference-body. We have to take into account that all our judgments in which time plays a part are always judgments of simultaneous events. We have tried here to translate familiar facts from the language of fluids, constructed according to the old mechanical view, into the new language of fields.
We have tried to indicate the way leading to general relativity and the reasons forcing us to change our old views once more. We have tried to show the active forces which compel science to invent ideas corresponding to the reality of our world. We have two bodies, one hot, the other cold, or more precisely, one of a higher temperature than the other. We have two electrical substances. We have two long bar magnets, one suspended freely at its centre, the other held in the hand. We have two material points, with forces acting between them which depend only on the distance. We have two realities: matter and field. We have, 1 / ^ \ -, T= zznzr I ^~"~2^ 15 ^^d x=.vty ...,,=[._ V.-g Therefore the clock loses by an amount ^-^ per second of motion, to the second order of approximation.
We have, first, xl'1' = ?= x1ixcos1 sin?? We have, so to speak, forgotten what features in the world of experience caused us to frame those concepts, and we have great difficulty in representing the world of experience to ourselves without the spectacles of the old-established con- ceptual interpretation. We have, then, a rigid bar with a scale and a good clock. We have, therefore, 8F = 8.E - TSS O. IO THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT It will be assumed that the liquid has unit area of cross-section perpendicular .to the x axis and is bounded by the planes x = o have, then, 6E = - {:Kv6xdx and and x = 1. We heat the central part of the marble slab, but not the periphery, in which case two of our little rods can still be brought into coincidence at every position on the table.
We honour ancient Greece as the cradle of western science. We hope that Jewish national life in Palestine will make sufficiently great strides to become the basis of a new intellectual and cultural creativeness. We imagine a large portion of empty space, so far removed from stars and other appreciable masses, that we have before us approximately the conditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. We imagine a system of arbitrary curves (see Fig. We imagine further that at the two ends A and B of the rod, clocks are placed which synchronize with the clocks of the stationary system, that is to say that their indications correspond at any instant to the Otime of the stationary systemO at the places where they happen to be.
We imagine the surface of a large globe and a quantity of small paper discs, all of the same size. We imagine two clocks of identical construction ; the man at the railway-carriage window is holding one of them, and the man on the footpath the other. We imagine two practically-rigid bodies, each with a tract marked out on it. We imagine two practicallyrigid bodies, each with a tract marked out on it. We immediately notice that they are of exactly the same character; in each case the lines offeree lead from one end of the solenoid or bar to the other.
We inquire as to the quantity of energy enclosed by this surface, viewed in system k, that is, as to the energy of the light complex relatively to the system k. The spherical surfaceNviewed in the moving systemNis an ellipsoidal surface, the equation for which, at the time ? We inquire: How large is the probability of the latter state relative to the original one?
We interpret this behaviour as the behaviour of measuring-rods, docks and material points tinder the influence of the gravitational field G. Hereupon we introduce a hypothesis: that the influence of the gravitational field on measuringrods, clocks and freely-moving material points continues to take place according to the same laws, even in the case where the prevailing gravitational field is not derivable from the Galfleian special care, simply by means of a transformation of co-ordinates. We interpret this fact as indicating that now more of "something" is needed and we call this "something" heat.
We introduce in a space, which is free from Gravita- tion-field, a Galiliean Co-ordinate System K ( < , y, z, t) and also, another system K' (y' y' z' t') rotating uniformly rela- tive to K. The origin of both the systems as well as their 2-axes might continue to coincide. We introduce the contra- variant six-vector F ^ bv a/5 the equation (62) ^.f^v ^ ^/xa ^^vp ^, tt^' and also a contra-variant four-vector J _, which is the electrical current-densitv in vacuum. We introduce the contravariant six-vector associated with pa and also the contra.variant vector J,,_ of the density of the electric current. We just saw that x, y, z and t of an event can, for the moment, be defned only with respect to a certain chosen system of coordinates ( inertial system ).
We know all matter is built from a few kinds of particles. We know definitely that they are not always valid, as for instance in the case of a train turning a curve, a ship tossed in a storm or an aeroplane in a tail spin. We know from everyday experience that both systems will be "good", that physical experiments performed in a uniformly moving train or ship will give exactly the same results as on the earth. We know from experience that, for a suitably chosen co-ordinate system, the velocities of the stars are small as compared with the velocity of transmission of light. We know from mechanics that every body resists a change in its motion; the greater the mass, the stronger the resistance, and the weaker the mass, the weaker the resistance.
We know how well the old theory explains astronomical observations. We know less about the system at any given moment and are thus less able to say any- thing about its past or future. We know of only one sphere in which such amounts of energy per mass unit are released: namely, radioactive disintegration. We know of these quantities, which do not have a vector character, that they must depend linearly and homogeneously upon the dx?, and ? We know that @ is an in-variant witb respect to a.ny substitution, but we do not know @* this of ..;-a It is easy to demonstrate, however, that the - g latter quantity is an invariant with respect to any linear substitutions of the co-ordinates.
We know that a car does not become shorter when in motion and we also know that the driver can always compare his "good" watch with those he passes on the way, finding that they agree fairly well, contrary to your statement. We know that if the sphere is given a push, that is, if an external force is applied, the velocity will be changed. We know that it determines both material relations in the space-time continuum, e.g., the possible configurations of solid bodies, and also gravitational fields; but we do not know whether it plays a material part in the structure of the electric particles of which matter is made up. We know that it determines the metrical relations in the space-time continuum, e.g.
We know that matter is built up of electrically charged particles, but we do not know the laws which govern the constitution of these particles. We know that such pictures enable us to determine the wave-lengths of X-rays. We know that the spheres will either attract or repel each other. We know that this lantern remains per- manently in its place and thus forms a kind of fixed triangulation point for determining the earths orbit* a point which the inhabitants of the earth can take a sight on at any time of year. We know that two particles attract each other and that this force of attraction decreases with the square of the distance. We know, for example, that in 1600 years half of one gram of radium will disintegrate, and half will remain.
We know, therefore, at least in theory, how to de- termine the mass of a body or, more exactly, how many times greater one mass is than another. We learn the behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks and also of freely-moving material points with reference to K1 simply by mathematical transformation. We learned furthermore that some phenomena force us to assume that light is composed of elementary light quanta, differing for different wave-lengths. We lemark that in the same way, we can also form the a extension of a mixed tensor A a ^^ ^^ ^} .^ ^' ^^ .- r39) A- = /" - ^ A -f ^ A .
We look for those relations which make it possible for us when proper fundamental data are given to obtain the following quantities at every place and time, and therefore at every space- time point as functions of {r, y, z, t) :the vector of the electric force E, the magnetic induction M, the electrical induction <?, the magnetic force /, the electrical space-density p, the electric current s (whose relation hereafter to the conduc- tion current is known by the manner in which conduc- tivity occurs in the process), and lastly the vector w, the velocity of matter. We look upon the existence of the first group as a fundamental characteristics of space.
We make a distinction hereaf ter between " gravitational field " and " matter " in this way, that we denote everything but the gravitational field as " matter." We may add that this necessary formai property of the total system of equations leaves arbitrary the choice of the sign of the mem? We may ask ourselves the question whether they can be removed by a modification of the Newtonian theory. We may assume the existence of an ether; only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it, i.e. We may base upon this quantity the concepts of the straight line as the geodesic (?ods =0 ), the interval, the circle, and the angle, upon which the Euclidean plane geometry is built. We may call the invariant p ^/l u^ as the rest-density of Electricity.^ * See Note.
We may conceive the field as consisting of lines of force. We may express this as the "principle of relativity with respect to direction," and it has been shown how equations (laws of nature) may be found, in accord with this principle, by the aid of the calculus of tensors. We may look upon the principle of inertia as established, to a high degree of approximation, for the space of our planetary system, provided that we neglect the perturbations due to the sun and planets. We may look upon this from a slightly different point of view.
We may regard (r, y, z, t), i.e., the components of the vector OP, as functions of the " proper-time " r; let (.r, y^ i, denote the first differential- quotients, and {x, y\ z, f) the second differential quotients of ( ', 'f, -, t) with regard to r, then these may respectively 11 82 PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY be called the Velocity-vector, and the Accelercition-vector of the substantial point at P. Now we haye c2 t t ^ X X y y z ^=0 i.e., the ' Velocity'Vector ' is the time-like vector of unit measure in the direction of the world-line at P, the ' Accele- ration-vector^ at P is normal to the velocity-vector at P, and is in any case, a space-like vector. We may remark in passing that this property enables us to con- struct sensitive apparatus for detecting the existence of a current.
We may remark that we had to separate the two lines in our drawing, since otherwise they would coincide and be indistinguishable. We may say, without pretending to be rigorous: the readiness with which a body responds to the call of an external force depends on its inertial mass. We may still use the word ether, but only to express some phys- ical property of space. We may sum up as follows : According to the gen- eral theory of relativity space is endowed with phys- ical qualities ; in this sense, therefore, an ether exists. We may surmise the validity of the following proposition: If K is an inertial system, then every other system K' which moves uniformly and without rotation relatively to K, is also an inertial system; the laws of nature are in concordance for all inertial systems.
We may therefore say that this surface permanently encloses the same light complex. We may without difficulty impart more depth and vigour to these ideas by carrying out special imaginary constructions. We may, still more simply, identify this particular framework with the special local properties of space in that region. We met the same problem in the domain of light phenomena. We might also think that, regardless of the kind of gravitational field which may be present, we could always choose another reference-body such that no gravitational field exists with reference to it. We might at first sigbt feel doubtful whether (la) together w1th ( 6) suffic1ently define the entire field.
We might be inclined to attribute to tbe act of thinking complete independence from language if the individuai formed or were able to form bis concepts without tbe verbal guidance of bis environment. We might be inclined to attribute to the act of thinking complete independence from language if the individual formed or were able to form his concepts without the verbal guidance of his environment. We might do this at frequent intervals during the year; each time we should get on our piece of paper a position of the earth E with a date attached to it and a certain position in relation to the permanently fixed base SM.
We might imagine that, as regards geometry, our universe behaves analogously to a surface which is irregularly curved in its individual parts, but which nowhere departs appreciably from a plane: something like the rippled surface of a lake. We might meet with great experimental diffi- culties in constructing apparatus which would show whether light is capable of bending. We might say that the principle of the conservation of energy, having previously swallowed up that of the conservation of heat, now pro? We might try to avoid this peculiar diffi.culty by assuming a very bigb value for the limiting potential at infinity.
We might, of course, content ourselves with time values determined by an observer stationed together with the watch at the origin of the co-ordinates, and co-ordinating the corresponding positions of the hands with light signals, given out by every event to be timed, and reaching him through empty space. We must accept the concept of relative time in every c.s., because it is the best way out of our difficulties. We must act now if we are to act at all. We must again ask the questions which have already been answered by the corpuscular theory, to see whether the wave theory can do the answering just as well. We must always be ready to change these notions ^that is to say, the axiomatic sub-structure of physics in order to do justice to perceived facts in the most logically perfect way.
We must assume that the suspended particles perform an irregular move- ment-even if a very slow one-in the liquid, on 4 THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT account of the molecular movement of the liquid ; if they are prevented from leaving the volume V* by the partition, they will exert a pressure on the partition just like molecules in solution. We must be conscious of our alien race and draw the logical conclusions from it. We must be prepared to face tremendous difficulties in the attempt to describe the ether mechanically. We must briefly discuss the basic idea of these two systems. We must build spiritual and scien?
We must carefully bear in mind that our statement as to the growth of the disc- shadows, as they move away from S towards infinity, has in itself no objective meaning, as long as we are unable to employ Euclidean rigid bodies which can be moved about on the plane E for the purpose of comparing the size of the disc- shadows. We must carefully bear in mind that our statement as to the growth of the disc-shadows, as they move away from S towards infinity, has in itself no objective meaning, as long as we are unable to employ Euclidean rigid bodies which can be moved about on the plane E for the purpose of comparing the size of the disc-shadows. We must concentrate our attention on the circumstances which affect the steepness with which the velocity falls at the wall.
We must consider motions along curved paths, and our next step is to determine the laws governing such motions. We must draw attention here to one of these deviations. We must examine old ideas, old theories, although they belong to the past, for this is the only way to understand the importance of the new ones and the extent of their validity. We must experience many such surprises if the construction is to be successful. We must go back to mechanics and ask: WHAT IS A WAVE? We must have our own students' societies and adopt an attitude of courteous but consistent reserve to the Gentiles. We must have the courage to over- come them if we wish to understand the principles of classical mechanics which gave us the first clues and so formed the starting-point for the development of science.
We must have what we call some frame of reference, a mechanical scaffold, to be able to determine the positions of bodies. We must imagine a "flow" of electric charge from one conductor to the other during the short time in which the potential difference is equalized. We must know beforehand how to determine its length. We must learn once more to glory in our ancestors and our history and once again take upon ourselves, as a nation, cultural tasks of a sort calculated to strengthen our sense of the community.
We must not be surprised, therefore, that, so to speak, all physicists of the last century saw in classical me- chanics a firm and final foundation for all physics, yes, indeed, for all natural science, and that they never grew tired in their attempts to base Maxwell's theory of elec- tro-magnetism, which in the meantime was slowly begin- ning to win out, upon mechanics as well. We must not conceal from ourselves that an improvement in the present depressing situation is impossible without a severe struggle; for the handful of those who are really determined to do something is minute in comparison with the mass of the lukewarm and the misguided. We must not consider space and time separately in determining the time-space co-ordinates in another c.s.
We must not merely aid in this work, but we must adhere to the lofty outlook of the founder of the movement. We must not permit ourselves to be degraded into mere slaves of production. We must not tolerate this, however, as long as we still retain a tiny bit of calm reasoning and human feelings. We must not, however, leave it at that but learn by experience. We must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of interpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational field of giving all bodies the same acceleration, or, what comes to the same thing, on the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. We must now consider the problem of relativf motion of ether and matter from the point of view of electrical theory.
We must now go back to Michelson and Morley's experiment. We must overcome the horrible obstacles of national frontiers. We must prove that we are a people of sufficient vigor and vitality to accomplish our great task, to create a center and a sup port for future generations. We must remember, however, that the equations (57a) are already contained in the equations (53), so that the latter represent only seven independent equations. We must revolutionize our thinking, revolutionize our actions, and must have the courage to revolutionize relations among the nations of the world. We must take care, however, not to allow these misgivings to become prejudices which prevent us from forming an objective judgment.
We must take care, however, not to allow these suspicions to become prejudices which prevent us from forming an objective judgment. We must then, so to speak, go one floor higher. We must therefore ask you how you envisage your relations with our Academy after what has passed between yourself and the Prussian Academy. We must therefore have \Mv* = \kT. We must therefore have d (2)x?+(d (1) x????? We must try gradually to awaken in tbem a sense of solidarty whch will not, as hereto- . We must try gradually to awaken in them a sense of solidarity which does not, as hitherto, stop at frontiers. We must try to recognize what in our accepted tradition is damaging to our fate and dignity-and shape our lives ac?
We must try to surmount this barrier in the mind, and the patient reader will see that it is by no means a particularly difficult task. We must, of course, assume the presence of ele- mentary actions, such as the passing of electrons or photons through the holes. We must, once more, use our imagination and think about an idealized experiment. We must, therefore, give up the analogy between sound and light waves and turn to the second possibility: that all matter moves through the ether, which takes no part whatever in the motion. We need not consider the ques- tion here whether Newton hit upon the same mathe- matical methods independently of Leibnitz or not.
We need not, therefore, be surprised that they are using their preponderant influence on the schools and the press to prevent youth from being enlightened on this problem which is so vital to the sound and peaceful development of life in this country. We need only a solenoid or some other circuit, a bar magnet, and one of the many types of apparatus for detecting the exist- ence of an electric current. We need to pay great attention to our relations with the Arabs. We next lay four of these little rods on the marble slab so that they constitute a quadrilateral figure (a square), the diagonals of which are equally long. We no longer need the factitious assumption that particles belonging to different colours travel with the same speed through empty space.
We note that in an analogous way we may also form the extension of a mixed tensor :- A:.. = A; - {u,u, r}A + {ur, a}A; . We notice that in this case the leaves remain apart, instead of falling back to their normal position as in the second experiment. We notice that our whole nature resembles that of the social animals. We now 92 PRINCIPLE OF BELATIVITT / ask, why is this difference between the two bodies ? We now ask ourselves whether both clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the nonrotating Galileian reference-body K. As judged from this body, the clock at the centre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock at the edge of the disc is in motion relative to K in consequence of the rotation.
We now ask whether the field law of gravitation (and later on the field law of gravitation and electricity) could not be modified in a natural way without essential change so that the solution (1) would satisfy the field equations for all finite points, ie, also for x=0. We now ask: what is matter, what is an electron? We now assume that: If two tracts are found to be equal once and anywhere, they are equal always and everywhere. We now assume the Iaw of the conservation of momentum and apply it with respect to the z direction. We now calculate the entropy for our limiting case from (12). We now can perform the summation over s by replacing it by an integration from 0 to . We now can write (18) and (19) in the form of double sums as follows: (18a) , (19a) where ?
We now come to our concepts and judgments of space. We now consider the following system. We now define the macroscopic state of the gas. We now examine the course of light-rays in the static gravitational field. We now examine the infiuence exerted by the field of the mass M upon the metrica! We now have to ask ourselves what is the momentum transfer to the molecule for such changes of state. We now have to calculate the temperature of the system. We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured in the moving system, is propagated with the velocity c, if, as we have assumed, this is the case in the stationary system; for we have not as yet furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity.
We now have to take the last step in our process of generalization. We now have two waves : one creation by oscillation, the other by reflection; they travel in opposite directions and interfere with each other. We now imagine space to be measured from the stationary system K by means of the stationary measuring-rod, and also from the moving system k by means of the measuring-rod moving with it; and that we thus obtain the co-ordinates x, y, z, and ?, ?, ? We now imagine the axis of the rod lying along the axis of x of the stationary system of co-ordinates, and that a uniform motion of parallel translation with velocity v along the axis of x in the direction of increasing x is then imparted to the rod.
We now inquire as to the length of the moving rod, and imagine its length to be ascertained by the following two operations: (a) The observer moves together with the given measuring-rod and the rod to be measured, and measures the length of the rod directly by superposing the measuring-rod, in just the same way as if all three were at rest. We now inquire into the signification of ? We now inquire whether there is a relativity with respect to the state of motion of the space of reference; in other words, whether there are spaces of reference in motion relatively to each other which are physically equivalent. We now introduce the assumption that is an invariant.
We now make the assumption , which readily suggests itself, that this covariant system of equations also defines the motion of the point in the gravitational field in the case when there is no system of ref erence K0 , with respect to which the special theory of relativity holds good in a finite region. We now proceed to the second argument, to which, moreover, we shall return later. We now prove a. proposition which is of ten usef ul as evi? We now realize, with special clarity, how much in error are those theorists who believe that theory comes a in? We now seek only those tensors, which can be obtained from the fundaiiiental tensor </^ ^by differentiation alone. We now seek the tensor which can be obtained from the fundamental tensor alone, by differentiation.
We now shall inquire into the in- sights of definite nature which phys- ics owes to the special theory of relativity. We now turn to Maxwell's equations (19a), (19b), (20a), (20b), and introduce the notation:10 ? We now turn to the field equations (53). We now turn to this purely mathematical task, and we shall find that in its solution a fundamental r le is played by the invariant ds given in equation (3), which, borrowing from Gauss' s theory of surfaces, we have called the " linear element." We now write the field equations (la) in the form (G"v - 1g".G) + iql'.GO = - K(TI' + 4Kg". We nurse the hope of erecting in Palestine a home of our own national culture which shall help to awaken the near East to new economic and spiritual life.
We obtain 6A 6A ^^^^ ^Mr= -^~ -^ S/ Anti.si/mmefTical Extension of a Six-reHor. We obtain ?= 4.3 volts, a result agreeing in order magnitude with those of Herr Lenard. We obtain Maxwell's fi.rst system by generalizing the form given by Minkowski. We obtain f - / - - ~ o r=fj Q(d)dA+jfS d+(A)dA + m ax + W - m -00 MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES 1 5 On the right-hand side the second, fourth, etc., terms vanish since +(x) = #(- x) ; whilst of the first, third, fifth, etc., terms, every succeeding telm is very small compared with the preceding. We obtain the simplest transformations of the type of (24) and (25) if only two of the co-ordinates are to be transformed, and if all the a, which merely determine the new origin, vanish.
We obtain then for the indices 1 and 2, on account of the three independent conditions which the relations (25) furnish, ?x'1 = x1 cos?? We only must do everything in our power to safeguard against its abuse. We only need to think of the following. We owe it to a few writers of antiquity that the people in the Middle Ages could slowly extricate themselves from the superstitions and ignorance that had darkened!ife far more than half a millennium. We owe one of these to Heisen? We pass over his other contributions to the equation of state, to the problems of null-point energy, and photo- chemical reactions. We perform another experiment, using the same apparatus as before, again starting with the gold leaves hanging close together.
We picture the motion as a sequence of events in the one-dimensional space continuum. We place one of the discs anywhere on the surface of the globe. We place the fundamental tensor of the g,,.. in (27) instead of any given tensor A,,.., and thus bave a new tensor, namely, the extension of the funda? We proceed in like manner with each of these squares until finally the whole marble slab is laid out with squares. We proceed similarly in all other cases where forces of different kinds for instance, electric, magnetic, and the like are acting. We prove it in the following way; we substitute in (27) i.e. We put in (37) instead of any tensor A'^*'' the fundamental tensor g^^ and get from 132 PlllNClPLE OF IIELATIVITY it a new tensor, namely the extension of the fundamental tensor.
We put: Gim = (Tim 12 gim T) (2a) where we put: g^ T = T^_ = T (5) T is the scalar of the energy tensor of "matter", the right hand side of (2a) is a tensor. We quote once more : Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. We quote their answers: The inside observer: The light signal travelling from the centre of the room will reach the walls simultaneously, since all the walls are equally distant from the light source and the velocity of light is the same in all directions. We reach our goal, however, in the following way. We reach this goal by repeated appli?
We read in the Mechanics , for two thousand years attributed to him: The moving body comes to a standstill when the force which pushes it along can no longer so act as to push it. We recognise in this the usnal expression for the laws of conservation. We recognize in the concept of heat which appears here a similarity to other physical concepts. We recognize this a.t once by setting (61) Then in piace of (60a) we may set, in the usual notation of three-dimensiona.l vector analysis, - i'lH_ = curl E} i'lt div H = O. We refer the fourdimensional space-time continuum in an arbitrary manner to Gauss coordinates.
We refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of the earth round the sun (aberration), and to the influence of the radial components of the relative motions of the fixed stars with respect to the earth on the colour of the light reaching us from them. We regain the old theory from the higher level of the new one. We remark here that e^qmy, ey+qm^ are components of the vector e-\- \_vm'\, where v is a vector in the direction of the positive Z-axis, and i v i=^, and is the vector product of y and W2 ; similarly qe^-\-myym,,+qey are the components of the vector m\ye].
We remark that for =1, /x=l the equations 6''=:E', ?m' = M' immediately lead to the equations 6'= E, ;>i=M by means of a reciprocal Lurentz-transformatiun with ii as vector; and for o-=:o, the equation C' = o leads to C=p u; that the fundamental equations of Ather discussed in '! We remark that these results as to the mass are also valid for ponderable material points, because a ponderable material point can be made into an electron (in our sense of the word) by the addition of an electric charge, no matter how small. We remark that this result about the mass hold also for ponderable material mass ; for in our sense, a ponder- able material point may be made into an electron by the addition of an electrical charo^e which mav be as small as possible.
We remember how essential it was for an understanding of the phenomena of heat to distinguish between heat itself and temperature. We remember how it was in mechanics. We remember that the acceleration of a falling body is quite independent of its mass and that it was this fact which revealed the equality of gravitational and inertial mass. We remember that the forces of gravitation, electrostatics, and magnetism, obeying the laws of Newton and Coulomb, act along the line adjoining the two attracting or repelling bodies. We remember that the velocity of light in vacuo, or in other words, in ether, is 186,000 miles per second and that light is an electromagnetic wave spreading through the ether.
We remember the picture of the particle changing its position with time in the one-dimensional space. We remember: the velocity of light is the same in all inertial c.s. We repeat the drawing in which an electric current is induced by a changing mag- netic field. We replace (/> by the parallelogram defined by the two four-vectors U, V, and let us pass over to the conjugate plane </>'", which is formed by the perpendicular four-vectors U"^, V."^^ Ttie components of (P<A) are then equal to the 4 three-rowed under-determiuants D., D,, D^ Di of the matrix P. P, U.^ U/>^ U/^ u,^ V/^ -x- V.,-x- Y.-x- Y,7f Leaving aside the first column we obtain D,=p,(u,^v,^-u,^v.^)+p. We require the equation corresponding to Poisson's equation \J2cp = 47rtcp, where p denotes the density of matter.
We require to extend our ideas of the space-time continuum still farther. We require to find x' and t' when x and t are given. We restrict ourselves to the case of a tensor of the second rank, since this suffices to give a clear idea of the law of formation. We reverence ancient Greece as the cradle of western science. We rub the rubber rod with flannel and again bring it near the metal. We sandwich the concept of the field between that of the current and that of the magnetic pole in order to represent the acting forces in a simple way. We say that each substance has its individual heat capacit^^j)Y, specific heat. We say that the velocity depends on the mass of the body, being smaller if the mass is greater.
We scientists believe that a clear and widespread understanding of the facts and implications of the atomic discoveries is indispensable to a reasonable public stand on questions of international polities. We scientists, whose tragic destination has been to help in making the methods of annihilation more gruesome and more effective, must consider it our solemn and transcendent duty to do all in our power in preventing these weapons from being used for the brutal purpose for which they were invented. We secure the tensor character of T? We see again in this theory the application of a general point of view: the tendency to describe all phenomena by means of attractive and repulsive forces depending only on distance and acting betweenr un- changeable particles.
We see at once that a solenoid through which a current flows would serve as well as a bar magnet. We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their coIIective labor-not by force, but on the whole in faith? We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective laborNnot by force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules. We see directly that the four-vector of the kind represent- ed by (D,, Dy, D., D,) is perpendicular to the parallele- piped formed by (P U^ V^")- Generally we have (P/) = PD + P^D^. We see easily 1 that Det''^ \tOj ^^]=:o.
We see from (12) that the imaginary time co-ordinate x4, enters into the condition of transformation in exactly the same way as the space co-ordinates x1, x2, x3. We see from (4) that the current-density S" must everywhere vanish. We see however, that the other components of g should also differ from the values given in (4) as required by the condition y/ = 1 . We see immediately that our "timetable" can be represented by five points in our time-space plane. We see immediately why cutting a magnet causes two new poles to appear on the new ends, and why this more refined theory explains the facts of experiment i as well as 2.
We see it at once if we ])ut f(3l) r ^'23 = 1 CENEEALTSKD TTIEOT^Y OF RELATIVITY 151 Tlie first MaxwelHaii system is obtained bv a genera- lisation of the form given by Minkowski." We see k first the transformation law for the determinant i^= \9fA.V According to (II) GENERALISED TtlEORY OF RELATIVITY 115 measured with solid rods and clocks, in accordance with the special relativity theory. We see now that the greatest efforts are needed if this legacy of humanity's is to prove a blessing and not a curse. We see planets, stars, nebulae, although the light travels from them to our eyes through empty space. We see that in applying such transformations the equations of a straight line become equations of a straight line.
We see that in the theory developed the electro- magnetic force plays the part of an auxiliary concept, which owes its introduction in theory to the circumstance that the electric and magnetic forces possess no existence independent of the nature of motion of the co-ordinate system. We see that our whole nature resembles that of the social animals. We see that the app^^arance of a gravitation-field is con- nected with space-time variability of g ^s. We see that the rotational transformation in space (without the time transformation) which we studied before is contained in the Lorentz transformation as a special case. We see that, in contrast with the customary view, when v = ?c,?0 = . We see the last two embodied at least very nearly soin the orbits of the heavenly bodies.
We see then that the smaller one takes o, the more is the tensor concentrated in the neighborhood of the hypersurface x& 0. We see this expressed in the last equation of the Galileian transformation (t1 = t) The four-dimensional mode of consideration of the "world" is natural on the theory of relativity, since according to this theory time is robbed of its independence. We see, therefore, that the generalized conception of the energy tensor is in agreement with our former result. We seek for the pressure of light exerted on the reflecting surface, and for the direction, frequency, and intensity of the light after reflexion. We set , a is then to be looked upon as the angle between the velocities v and w. After a simple calculation we obtain .
We settle all such questions by the use of a thermometer, an instrument designed in a primitive form by Galileo. We sh^ll now see the consequences of admitting a velocity W > c. Let A and B be separated by distance /, and let velocity of a ^^sij^nal " in the system S be W>(". We shall also refer these masses to a system of co-ordinates K', uniformly accelerated with respect to K. Relatively to K' all the masses have equal and parallel accelerations; with respect to K' they behave just as if a gravitational field were present and K' were unaccelerated.
We shall also test for co-variance the equations which express the dependence of the stress components upon the properties of the matter, and set up these equations for the case of a compressible viscous fluid with the aid of the conditions of co-variance. We shall assume that the principles of momentum and energy are valid for the body. We shall assume that this dependence is a linear one. We shall base our analysis on this formula, keeping in mind that our results are only valid within certain limits. We shall be able to solve the problem when it will be clearly evident to all that there is no other, no cheaper way out of the present situation. We shall be chiefly concerned with the role of thoughts and ideas in the adventurous search for knowledge of the physical world.
We shall be satisfied with the following criterion, which we regard as reasonable. We shall be true to the principle of relativity in its broadest sense if we give such a form to the laws that they are valid in every such fourdimensional system of co-ordinates, that is, if the equations expressing the laws are co-variant with respect to arbitrary transformations. We shall begin with a discussion of the experiment which created serious difficulties in our mechanical interpretation. We shall begin with our first picture and assume, for the present: the ether is carried along by the room moving with its rigidly connected light source. We shall begin with refraction, but it will be useful to consider first an example having nothing to do with optics.
We shall calculate this integral, first with respect to the inertial system which we have chosen, and second, with respect to a system relatively to which the matter has the velocity zero. We shall call "primary concepts" such concepts as are di? We shall call the whole thing an electric dipole. We shall call this function the probability wave. We shall call v the vector, the direction of v the axis, and the magnitude of V the moment of this transformation. We shall come back to this point of view later. We shall consider in detail only one of many ex- periments which are able to supply us with an answer. We shall consider only the special case in which the acceleration-vector of m is always zero ; * K. Schwarzschild.
We shall consider these laws now, in order to be able to apply them later. We shall deal first only with the properties of tensors with respect to the transformation from one Cartesian system to another in the same space of reference, by means of linear orthogonal transformations. We shall decompose the sic/iel into elementary space-time filaments^ and every one of these filaments in small elements (It of its proper-time, which are however large compared to the linear dimensions of the normal cross-section; let us assume that the mass of such a lilament vdJn=dm and write t", t^ for the ^Proper-time' of the upper and lower boundary of the slc/iel.
We shall define a space-time Vector of the 2nd kind as a system of six-magnitudes /"^ 3 j/si fziJ with the condition that when subjected to a Lorentz transformation, it is changed to a new system /^ 3' /"g^,... which satis- fies the connection between (23) and (24). We shall describe a primitive and naive experiment showing this. We shall discuss them once more, in the same order as before, but in the light of the theory of electric fluids. We shall do this here in the form of a dialogue between N and //, where N is a believer in Newton's corpuscular theory, and H in Huygen's theory. We shall draw certain conclusions from this principle of "relativity of translation" just as we have already done for relativity of direction. We shall examine this question in the following.
We shall first deduce some of the lemmas much used afterwards. We shall form the equations (21) for the points of the normal cross section of the filament through .<, y^ z, t, and integrate them, multiply- ing by the elementary contents of the cross section over the whole space of the normal section. We shall give both processes the name 'changes of state due to irradiation'. We shall have principally to deal with matrices with at most four vertical columns and for horizontal rows.
We shall have to do constantly with functions of the space-time point (^r, y, c, it), and we may with advantage I'Hfi DIFFERENTIAL OPERATOR LOR 41 employ the 1x4 series matrix, formed of differential symbols, d a a a a " a 2/ a^ ^a^' or (6;^) a a a.t'i a.t^2 as a** For this matrix I shall use the shortened from " lor. We shall here try to describe the first philosophical ideas on the aim of science. We shall illusti*ate it by the following example ; Let two fluid bodies of equal kind and magnitude swim freeh^ in space at such a great distance from one another (and from all other masses) that only that sort of gravitational forces are to be taken into account which the parts of any of these bodies exert upon each other. We shall imagine the air above it to have been removed.
We shall make the slightly incorrect assumption that in every c.s. We shall make use of this result in what follows. We shall meet with this point of view again in the theories of special and general relativity. We shall men- tion only some of these unsolved problems. We shall not assume anything concerning the law in accordance with which the points move in this space except that with regard to this motion, no part of the space (and no direction within it) can be distinguished from 9 any other. We shall not consider the motion of stars until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity. We shall not discuss here the justification for this incidental conception, which is indeed a somewhat arbitrary one.
We shall not enter into this problem, however, but shall directly investigate the derivation of the function ? We shall not go into detailed description of the many experiments from which this important conclusion can be drawn. We shall not have the secret very long. We shall not quote them here; they belong to the almost for- gotten past. We shall now assume that the first body supposed to be at rest, has the length /, i.e., the cross section PP of the first strip upon the .-axis^/* OC, where OC is the unit measuring rod upon the j^-axisand the second body also, when supposed to be at rest, has the same length I, this means that, the cross section Q'Q' of the second strip has a cross-section I'OC, when measured parallel to the ''-axis.
We shall now briefly consider how this unification came about, and what meaning is to be attached to it. We shall now consider the changes which take place in the momentum and energy of the body as a result of this action. We shall now do the same with quantum physics, referring only very briefly to the work of Bohr, de Broglie, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Dirac and Born. We shall now examine this dependence quantitatively. We shall now point out the underlying ideas of a very simple and naive theory which explains all the facts described. We shall now show briefly that there are geometrical entities which lead to the concept of tensors. We shall now show that this equation leads to the same law of motion of a material particle as that already obtained.
We shall now turn our attention to these purely matheniati- cal propositions. We shall only mention that with its aid electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented much more satisfactorily than without it, and this applies particularly to the transmission of electromagnetic waves. We shall proceed from the consideration of such regions as a special case of known properties. We shall proceed here in the same manner as before, starting with very simple facts and then seeking their theoretical explanation. We shall proceed to show that both the general postulate of relativity and the fact of the small stellar velocities are corn?
We shall recall them by quoting a few lines from lectures given about a hundred and fifty years ago by Black, who contributed a great deal toward clearing up the difficulties connected with the two concepts, heat and temperature : By the use of this instrument we have learned, that if we take 1000, or more, different kinds of matter, such as metals, stones, salts, woods, feathers, wool, water and a variety of other fluids, although they be all at first of different heats, let them be placed together in the same room without a fire, and into which the sun does not shine, the heat will be communicated from the hotter of these bodies to the colder, during some hours perhaps, or the course of a at the end of which time, if we apply a thermometer to them all in succession, it will point precisely to the same degree.
We shall refer to this shortly in the paragraph next but one. We shall return to this point later. We shall say: our space has the physical property of transmitting waves, and so omit the use of a word we have decided to avoid. We shall see later how clear, instructive, and far- reaching our new language is. We shall see later on that this way of looking at it, the intellectual possibility of which I shall try to make clearer by a comparison that does not quite fit at all points, is justified by the results of the gen- eral theory of relativity. We shall see later that by such a restriction of the choice of co-ordinates it is possible to achieve an important simplification of the laws of nature.
We shall see later that this point of view, the conceivability of which I shall at once endeavour to make more intelligible by a somewhat halting comparison, is justified by the results of the general theory of relativity. We shall see later that this result, which expresses the theorem of the addition of velocities employed in classical mechanics, cannot be maintained ; in other words, the law that we have just written down does not hold in reality. We shall show directly that the answer must be in the negative. We shall show here only the connection between the fulfilment of this programme and two principal problems: gravitation and geometry. We shall show, however, that this as- sumption, together with the criterion of reality given above, leads to a contradiction.
We shall simplify the experiment further by assuming that the source emits homogeneous light. We shall soon see that the generai theory of relativity cannot adhere to this simple physical interpretation of space and time. We shall soon see whether it is any- thing more than a new representation of the acting forces. We shall speak of its essential significance later. We shall still use the "dynamic" and not the "static" language in the following pages, bearing in mind its limitations. We shall suppose that the rods " expand " by in amount proportional to the increase of temperature. We shall take as an axis the line determined by the incoming ray. We shall tberefore interpret this motion as a motion under the influence of a gravitational feld.
We shall then be able to apply the laws of nature to any c.s. We shall then have very many points on our time-space plane. We shall then, I feel sure, have to return to the attempt to carry out the program which may properly be described as the Maxwellian ^namely, the description of physical reality in terms of fields which satisfy partial differ- ential equations without singularities. We shall thereby be following not merely the dictates of Providence but also our traditions, which alone give the Jewish community meaning and stability. We shall try to reconstruct the line of progress logically, without bothering too much about chronological order.
We should catch them in a reverse order to that in which they were sent, and the train of happenings on our earth would appear like a film shown backward, beginning with a happy ending. We should expect, for instance, that the note emitted by an organpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel would be different from that emitted if the axis of the pipe were placed perpendicular to this direction. We should have to investigate the dependence of the force upon the velocity of the magnet, upon its shape, and upon the shape of the circuit. We should have to make corrections, according to our distance from the clock, in all our time readings.
We should like to be able to predict the position of the earth and the other planets for any arbitrary instant of time, we should like to predict the date and duration of the next solar eclipse and many other astronomical events. We should like to know what number expresses the rate of exchange, i.e., how much heat we obtain from a given amount of mechanical energy. We should not be astonished that the numbers are so small. We should not have survived as a community all the centuries if we had had a bed of roses. We should not have survived for thousands of years as a community if our bed had been of roses; of that I am quite sure. We should obtain white light from the previously separated colours. We should really call it half a step rather than a whole one.
We should then be justified (because of its merits for the description of natural phenomena) in calling this system " absolutely at rest," and all other Galileian systems K " in motion." We shtill say that {x y' z t') are the co-ordinates measured in the system k' ^ then by a * Yxde Note 9. We soon saw that these had already been established by Riemann (the tensor of curva- ture). We speak of the force by which the earth compels ourselves and all the objects about us to remain within its sphere of in- fluence, and of the force with which the wind makes waves on the sea, or moves the leaves of trees. We speak of the force of attraction between the sun and the earth, the earth and the moon, and of those forces which cause the tides. We stand, therefore, at the parting of the ways.
We start from a Euchdean space of four dimensiona, 1, 2 , g3 g4 , with a linear element d<T ; let, therefore, d1T 2 = a: + a; + a + a (9) In this space we consider the byper-surface R2 = : + : + + (., . We start off again from quite special cases, which we have frequently used before. We start off on a consideration of a Galileian domain, i.e. We start with an empty, field-free space, as it occurs N related to an in- ertial system N in the sense of the spe- cial theory of relativity, as the simplest of all imaginable physical situations. We start with the special theory of relativity. We still have the sphere, but it is immersed in a medium of a different kind, a sort of jelly instead of air or water.
We still have to answer the question: why are these two pictures, equivalent from the point of view of classical physics, not equivalent from the point of view of the relativity theory? We still have to find the amplitude of the waves, as it appears in the moving system. We still wish to compare the average magnitude of the energy quanta of the blackbody radiation with the average translational kinetic energy of a molecule at the same temperature. We suppose a light-signal sent out from the origin of K at the time t = 0. We suppose a very long train travelling along the rails with the constant velocity v and in the direction indicated in Fig 1. We suppose further that the states of the two systems before t=0 were known.
We suppose that the circumference and diameter of this circle bave been measured with a unit measure infinitely small compared with the radius, and that we bave the quotient of the two results. We suppose that the space is measured by the stationary measuring rod placed in the stationary system, as well as by the moving measuring rod placed in the moving ON THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES 9 system, and we thus obtain the co-ordinates (3c,y^z) for the stationary system, and (^, yy, ^) for the moving system. We suppose these laid in series along the periphery and the diameter of the circle, at rest relatively to K'. We take in our hand the end of a very long flexible rubber tube, or a very long spring, and try to move it rhythmically up and down, so that the end oscillates.
We talked of a cart, moving uniformly in a straight line and receiving a push in the direction of its motion which increases its velocity. We that is to say, the Arabs and ourselves have got to agree on the main outlines of an advantageous partnership which shall satisfy the needs of both nations. We then feel satisfied when we succeed in tracing back the ethical directive in question to these basic premises. We then have the following law: The gravitational mass of a body is equal to its inertial law. We then must endeavor to adopt whatever appears best, irre? We then obtain for the different from zero, let p31 = ? We then obtain from our equation, An ; D exp 1 as the condition for dynamical equilibrium.
We therefore arrive at the conclusion: the greater the energy density and the wavelength of a radiation, the more useful do the theoretical principles we have employed turn out to be: for small wavelengths and small radiation densities, however, these principles fail us completely. We therefore arrive at the result: the gravitational field influences and even determines the metrical laws of the space-time continuum. We therefore arrive at this result. We therefore call r the proper time of the material particle. We therefore conclude from these considerations that the energy per unit volume has the character of a tensor. We therefore find, to the desired approximation, that Q'(V', <P') dv' dx' ,'A , e(v) dv dx v =l-2-cosp, c 14 (14') or Q'{v', ?')
We therefore give (hypothetically) an objective significance to the statement of the simultaneity of distant events, while previously we have been concerned only with the simultaneity of two experiences of an individual. We therefore have to cboose r,-1 - q- 2 "' 1 Q-4 t ;::" ( o; f )-L, = cons } (12) and therefore ' T;k =!.j'Yik, T44= } a. We therefore reach this result :-In the genera! We therefore see that we can attach no absolute signiticanee to the concept of synchro- nism ; but two events which ara synchronous vdien viewed from one system, will not be synchronous when viewed from a system movin<^ relatival v to this svstem. We think of a substance as something which can be neither created nor destroyed. We think that grass is green, that stones are hard, and that snow is cold.
We thus arrive at a conception of the relation of science to religion very different from the usual one. We thus arrive at an extension of the relativity postulate. We thus arrive at the important result: Events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not simultaneous with respect to the train, and vice versa (relativity of simultaneity). We thus deduce the conception that g *s describe the gravitational field. We thus find the occurrence of a gravitational feld connecte with a space-time variability of the gu . We thus free ourselves from the distasteful conception that the material universe ought to possess something of the nature of a centre.
We thus get fxar A = B^ A jXTCr fJ.CT p (^3)^ fXCTT 6_ iidf _6_ ^/XT to- ) tp J (a GENERALISED THEOllY OF RELATIVITY 138 The essential thing in this result is that on the right hand side of (42) we have only A , but not its differential co-efficients. We thus obtain the equ,_11.tion ,. We thus obtain the equations Pik - ahikP - hikG 0 = O (16) 'p + }Go = - "P ; (17) From the scalar of equation (16) and from (17) we obtain G0 = - %P = 2Kp, {18) and consequently from (16) Pik - "P'Yik = O . We thus require a definition of simultaneity such that this definition supplies us with the method by means of which, in the present case, he can decide by experiment whether or not both the lightning strokes occurred simultaneously.
We thus see that the velocity of transmission relative to the reference-body K1 is also equal to c. The same result is obtained for rays of light advancing in any other direction whatsoever. We thus write the equation of the surface a? We took no notice of the fact that all ob- servations must be made in a certain c.s. We tried to save the Galilean relativity principle by assuming that systems carry the ether along in their motion, but this led to a contradiction with experiment. We try to compose a comprehensive picture of the world in which we are at home and which gives us a stability that cannot be found in our external life. We try to create a new substance, energy, with heat as one of its forms. We try to use a simple expression for the force.
We try to use the same method of translation for matter as for light. We understand by a clock something which provides a series of events which can be counted, and which has other properties of which we shall speak later. We understand now why we have to touch the metal before beginning the experiment. We understand that our picture of an electromag- netic wave, spreading with a certain velocity in space and changing in time, follows from Maxwell's equa- tions only because they describe the structure of the electromagnetic field at any point in space and for any instant. We use the same clock in all our c.s. We used the two-pillared structure only for the sake of clearness and economy. We very often speak of small portions of a spherical wave far removed from the source as plane waves.
We w1ll try to formulate tbis condition mathematically. We want the observed facts to follow logically from our concept of reality. We want to demonstrate in the present paper that this far-reaching requirement is in fact satisfied quite generally, thus lending new support to our simple hypotheses concerning the elementary processes of emission and absorption. We were forced to apply the statistical method provided by the probability waves. We were forced, by our general aim, to make a definite choice of facts and ideas. We were led to that conflict by the considerations of Section 6, which are now no longer tenable.
We wil now calculate with the help MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES 17 of this equation the displacement Xz in the direc- tion of the X-axis which a particle experiences on an average, or-more accurately expressed-the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of displacements in the direction of the X-axis ; it is Aa = 45 = J Z t . ' We wilI now refer the motion of each particle to a Co-ordinate 16 THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT system whose origin coincides at the time t = o with the position of the centre of gravity of the particles in question ; with this difference, that f(x, t)dx now gives the number of the particles whose x Co-ordinate has increased between the time t = o and the time t = t, by a quantity which lies between x and x + dx.
We will assume that, in the sense of the special theory of relativity, g always has a finite negative value. We will call that which is enclosed between two boundaries, marked upon a practically-rigid body, a tract. We will call this completed geometry "practical geometry," and shall distinguish it in what follows from "purely axiomatic geometry." We will call this completed geometry practical geometry, and shall distinguish it in what follows from purely axiomatic geometry.
We will call x,, yI, x, the rectangular Co-ordinates of the centre of gravity of the first particle, x,, y,, x, those of -the second, etc., x,, y,, x, those of the last particle, and allocate for the centres of gravity of the particles the indefinitely small domains of parallelopiped form dg,, dy,, dzl ; dxzt MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES 7 dy2, dz,, . We will consider their state of dynamic equilibrium, on the assumption that a force K acts on the single particles, which force depends on the position, but not on the time.
We will elucidate it by the following example :-Two :fluid bodies of the same size aud nature hover freely in space at so great a distance from each other and from all other rnasses that only those gravitational forces need be taken into account wbich a.rise from the interaction of different parts of the same body. We will introduce a time-interval T in our dis- cussion, which is to be very small compared with the observed interval of time, but, nevertheless, of such a magnitude that the movements executed by a particle in two consecutive intervals of time r are to be considered as mutually independent phenomena (8).
We will now assume that {> is !inear in the gcr-r' and that the coefficients of the g; depend only on the g,,.. We may then replace the principle of variation (1) by one which is more convenient for us. We will now determine the kinetic energy of the electron. We will now enumerate the properties of the motion of the electron which result from the system of equations (A), and are accessible to experiment. We will only mention in passing that our empirical principle of the equality of inert and heavy masses prompts us to answer this question in the affirmative. We will show that for a space-time measurement in the system K', the above established rules for the physical significance of time and space can not be maintained.
We will try in what follows to make this clearer, keeping both earlier and later de- velopments in sight. We wish to be able to predict events and to determine by experiment whether observation confirms these predictions and thus the initial assumptions. We wish to know the constitution of these waves, when they are examined by an observer at rest in the moving system k. Applying the equations of transformation found in 6 for electric and magnetic forces, and those found in 3 for the co-ordinates and the time, we obtain directly X0 = X0 sin?0, L0 = L0 sin?0, Y, Z, ? We wish to picture to ourselves the whole relation graphically. We would afterwards see that sueh a limitation of the choice of co-ordinates would produce a significant simplification in expressions for laws of nature.
We would further investigate the rate of going of a unit-clock Avhich is placed in a statical gravitational field. We write the equations (A) in the form and remark firstly that are the components of the ponderomotive force acting upon the electron, and are so indeed as viewed in a system moving at the moment with the electron, with the same velocity as the electron. We write the equations (A) in the form myS' d\c dt'' .eX= eX' ^ m/S' ^4-^ =e/3 r dt^ - '^] =^Y' y mp' ^; =e/3 rZ+ ^' mJ =eZ' and let us first remark, that ^X', eY', eZ' are the com- ponents of the ponderomotive force acting upon the electron, and are considered in a moving system which, at this moment, moves with a velocity which is equal to that of the electron.
We, therefore, conclude : The change of an electric field produced by the motion of a charge is always accompanied by a magnetic fold. Well, everyone who is of sufficient inter? Well, everyone who is of sufficient interest to the public to be pursued by interviewers. Well, formulated in that way the question really means nothing, since every system of equations can be ex- pressed in general co-ordinates. Were an angel of the Lord to come and drive all the people belonging to these two categories out of the temple, it would be noticeably emptier, but there would still be some men, of both present and past times, left inside.
Were his country, because it feels itself for the time being militarily secure, to stand aloof from the aspiration to create a supra-national system of security and justice?

What Brown observed was the unceasing agitation of the granules when suspended in water and visible through the microscope. What I have to say is nothing new and does not pretend to be anything more than the expression of the opinion of an independent and honest man who, unburdened by class or national prejudices, desires nothing but the good of humanity and the most harmonious 88 ON POLITICS, GOVERNl\rIENT, Al"lffi PACIFISM possible scheme of human existence.
What I have to say is nothing new and does not pretend to be anything more than the opinion of an independent and honest man who, unburdened by class or national prejudices, desires nothing but the good of humanity and the most harmonious possible scheme of human existence. What I see is a light signal travelling with a standard speed, the same in all directions. What I wrote then still seems essentially as true as ever; yet, it all seems curiously remote and strange.

What a deep conviction of the rationality of the universe and what a yearning to understand, were it but a feeble reflection of the mind revealed in this world, Kepler and Newton must have had to enable them to spend years of solitary labour in disentangling the principles of celestial mechanics! What a deep faith in the rationality of the structure of the world and what a longing to understand even a small glimpse of the reason revealed in the world there must have been in Kepler and Newton to enable them to unravel the mechanism of the heavens, in long years of lonely work! What a fruitful source of suffering to mankind this fact is!
What appears certain to me, however, is that, in the foundations of any consistent field theory, there shall not be, in addition to the concept of feld, any concept concerning particles. What are ten years in the history of humanity? What are the laws of disposition of the disc-shadows L' on the plane E? What are the values x1, y1, z1, t1, of an event with respect to K1, when the magnitudes x, y, z, t, of the same event with respect to K are given ? What bopes and fears does the scientific method imply for mankind? What can be done tbat this spirit be gaioed in the scbool? What can be done that this spirit be gained in the scbool? What can right-minded people, people who are proof against the emotional temptations of the moment, do to repair the damage?
What complicates the solution, however, is the fact that while most people readily agree on what is meant by "science," they are likely to differ on the meaning of "religion." What conclusions can be drawn in the domain of field phenomena if motion through ether is assumed? What distinguisbes the language of science from language as we ordinarily understand the word? What distinguishes the language of science from language as we ordinarily understand the word? What do we mean by "two simultaneous events in one c.s."? What do we wish to express when we say that our space is infinite? What does a :fish know about the water in which he swims all his life? What does it mean in the wave theory? What does it mean that these equations describe the structure of the field?
What does it mean to assign to an event the particular co-ordinates x1, x2, x3, x4, if in themselves these co-ordinates have no significance ? What does this talk of straight-line, point, intersection, etc., conveying something to one, mean? What experiments prove convincingly that the two masses are the same? What first strikes the visitar with amazement is the superiority of this country in matters of technology and organization. What first strikes the visitor with amazement is the superiority of this country in matters of technics and organization. What happens between the instant they are brought into contact and the achievement of equal temperatures? What happens now if a wave is created at one end of the rubber tube or cord?
What happens to the single system remains, it is true, entirely unclarified by this mode of con? What happens to these two bodies? What happens when a stone is thrown straight upward? What happens when two sets of clocks are moving uniformly, relative to each other? What has been changed is the destructiveness of war. What has been preserved of their work belongs among the most precious posses? What has been said here in a few words would fill volumes if all theoretical and experimental details were set forth. What has brought them to the temple? What has happened to the energy? What has nature to do with our co-ordinate systems and their state of motion ? What has nature to do with the coordinate systems that we propose and with their motions?
What has surprised me most in your genera!attitude, ex? What hopes and fears does the scientific method imply for mankind? What in that case becomes of the material points of which light is composed, when the light is absorbed? What is demanded of a theory which attempts to describe nature? What is essential is, that the electric and magnetic force of the light which is influenced by a moving body, be transformed into a system of co-ordinates at rest relatively to the body.
What is fundamentally new in the ether of the general theory of relativity as opposed to the ether of Lorentz consists in this, that the state of the former is at every place determined by connections with the matter and the state of the ether in neighbouring places, which are amenable to law in the form of differential equations; whereas the state of the Lorentzian ether in the absence of electromagnetic fields is conditioned by nothing outside itself, and is everywhere the same. What is happening is that the two groups are undergoing a common development on common ground and are both being influenced by the same factors, just as is the case with the heterogeneous mixture of peoples that inhabit Europe. What is here meant by the number of dimensions, I think I may assume to be known.
What is interesting here is that this relation is independent of both the length of the pendulum and the fann of the path through which the mass moves. What is it that brings about such an intimate comiection between language and thinking? What is it that brings about such an intimate connection between language and thinking? What is lacking in the majority is the conviction, founded on clear thinking, that there is no other means of permanetly avoiding catastrophes like the present on. What is meant by the statement that a moving clock changes its rhythm? What is meant by the statement that absolute and not only relative uniform motion exists?
What is remarkable in this resul t is that the cornponent g44 of the fundamental tensor alone defines, to a first approximation, the motion of the materiai point. What is so marvelously attractive about Bohr as a scien- tific thinker is his rare blend of boldness and caution ; seldom has anyone possessed such an intuitive grasp of hidden things combined with such a strong critical sense. What is stili lacking here is a grasp of connec? What is stili lacking here is a grasp of connections of profound generality, but not a knowledge of order in itself. What is the length of the metre-rod relatively to the system K? What is the meaning of human life, or of organic life altogether? What is the meaning of human life, or, for that matter, of the life of any creature?
What is the mechanism of this inner pressure according to the kinetic theory? What is the rate of this clock, when viewed from the stationary system? What is the reason for this Preference? What is the reason for this peculiar lack of adaptability? What is the simplest arrangement? What is the velocity corresponding to this time and position? What justifies us in dispensing with the preference for inertial systems over all other co-ordinate systems, a preference that seems so securely established by experience? What kind of changes are now spreading in the case of an electro- magnetic wave?
What made the greatest impression upon the student, however, was less the technical construction of mechanics or the solution of complicated problems than the achieve- ments of mechanics in areas which apparently had noth- ing to do with mechanics: the mechanical theory of light, which conceived of light as the wave-motion of a quasi -rigid elastic ether, and above all the kinetic theory of gases: the independence of the specific heat of mon- atomic gases of the atomic weight, the derivation of the equation of state of a gas and its relation to the specifir' heat, the kinetic theory of the dissociation of gases, and above all the quantitative connection of viscosity, heat- conduction, and diffusion of gases, which also furnished the absolute magnitude of the atom.
What made this theory appear revolutionary was the transition from forces at a distance to fields as fundamental variables. What makes the present position so bad is the fact that Jews and Arabs confront each other as opponents before the mandatory power. What man sees before him from infancy causes no reaction of this kind; he is not surprised over the falling of bodies, con- cerning wind and rain, nor concerning the differences be- tween living and non-living matter. What now is known is only how to use a fairly large quantity of uranium. What ought the minority of intellectuals to do against this evil? What place does the theoretical physicist's picture of the world occupy among all these possible pictures ?
What really matters is the change of the magnetic field making the induced current stronger if the change is greater. What rendered the insight into the essence of electro- magnetic theory so much more difficult at that time was the following peculiar situation. What science strives for is an utmost acuteness and clarity of concepts as regards their mutuai relation and their correspondence to sensory data. What science strives for is an utmost acuteness and clarity of concepts as regards their mutual relation and their correspondence to sensory data. What social aim could be closer to our hearts? What soon makes the new arrivai devoted to this country is the democratic trait among the people. What takes piace can be illustrated with the help of our rich man.
What task could possibly be more important for us? What the nineteenth century achieved on the strength of this basis, especially through the application of the partial differential equa- tions, was bound to arouse the admiration of every re- ceptive person. What this means may be expressed as follows: Two points marked on a rigid body form an interval. What was needed, therefore, was to frame a theory whose equations kept their form in the case of non- linear transformations of the co-ordinates. What we call physics comprises that group of natural sci? What we observe here is the phenomenon known as refraction. What we seek to determine are average values typifying the whole aggregation. What will be his experience in this enterprise ? What will happen in the medium?
What will happen to the stick which shrank to nothing when its velocity was that of light? What would happen if we reduced the intensity of the primary cathode rays or the size of P1 on which they fall, so that the impact of an electron of the primary cathode rays can be considered an isolated process? What you must fight for is liberation from universal military service. What's your next step, my friend? What, according to the kinetic theory, can we expect to hap- pen? What, according to the relativity theory, is the law for great velocities, approaching that of light? What, however, can the man of good will do to combat this deeply rooted prejudice? What, precisely, is "thinking"?
What, then, are the feelings and the needs which have brought mankind to religious thought and to faith in the widest sense? What, then, in all this, is the function of education and of the school? What, then, in all this, is tl1e function of education and of the school? Whatever carne from this supreme mind was as lucid and beautiful as a good work of art and was pre? Whatever is morally important in our institutions, laws, and mores can be traced back to interpretation of the sense of justice of countless individuals. Whatever the meaning assigned to the term conzp/eEe, the following requirement for a com- plete theory seems to be a necessary one: every element of the physical reality must have a counter part in the physical theory We shall ca.
Whatever this tool in the band of man will produce depends entirely on the nature of tbe goals alive in this man? Whatever this tool in the hand of man will produce depends entirely on the nature of the goals alive in this mankind. Whatever we do for Palestine we do it for the honour and well-being of the whole Jewish people. When H. A. Lorentz started his creative scientifc work, Max? When I came to Germany fifteen years ago I discovered for the first time that I was a Jew, and I owe this discovery more to Gentiles than Jews. When I leamed about it, I was some? When I say they are of equal length, I mean that one can be laid on any other without the ends overlapping.
When Newton described space as absolute, he no doubt meant this real significance of space, which made it necessary for him to attribute to it a quite definite state of motion, which yet did not appear to be fully determined by the phenomena of mechanics. When a body emits an energy e, it has a recoil (momentum) e/c, provided the whole of the radiation is emitted in the same direction. When a decision has been reached on any subject in which not less than three members on each side concur, it may be published, but only in the name of the whole Council. When a man is talking about scientific subjects, the little word I should play nt^part in his expositions. When a velocity is equal to that of light it is impossible to increase it further.
When an agreement on these points shall bave been reached, a guarantee against wars of world-wide dimensions can be assured. When and where we observe a change in velocity, an external force, in the general sense, must be held responsible. When applied to an electromagnetic field, the general law of transformation furnishes, for the special case of the special Lorentz transformation, the equations ? When confronted with a specific case, however, it is no easy task to detennine clearly what is desirable and what should be eschewed, just as we find it difficult to decide what exactly it is that makes good painting or good music. When considering the actual living conditions of present? When discussing measurements in classical mechanics, we used one clock for all c.s.
When first studying mechanics one has the impres- sion that everything in this branch of science is simple, fundamental and settled for all time. When formulating the principal clues of mechanics we omitted one important point. When in the first half of the nineteenth century the far-reaching similarity was revealed which subsists between the properties of light and those of elastic waves in ponderable bodies, the ether hypothesis found fresh support. When language becomes thus partially independent from the background of impressions a greater inner coherence is gained. When light was shown to exhibit interference and diffraction, it seemed almost certain that light should be considered a wave.
When man becomes conscious of the rules concerning the relations between signs the so-called grammar of language is established. When one thinks how pitiable, taken as a whole, have been the results of former conferences, it becomes clear that it is the duty of all intelligent and responsible people to exert their full powers to remind public opinion again and again of the importance of the 1932 Conference. When one views the matter historically one is inclined to look upon science and religion as irreconcilable antagonists, and for a very obvious reason. When one views the matter historically, one is inclined to look upon science and religion as irreconcilable antagonists, and far a very obvious reason.
When set free it starts roll- ing down under the force of gravity, and then goes up and down along a fantastically curved line, giving the occupants a thrill by the sudden changes in velocity. When someone realizes that for the achievement of an end certain means would be useful, the means itself becomes thereby an end. When someone realizes that for the achievement of an end certain rneans would be usef ul, the means itself becomes thereby an end.
When specializing the coordinate choice in accordance with (3a), it follows from it, that the Tim shall fulfill the conditions: T^/x = 12 g^/x T (7) or T^/x = ^ T^ (7a) If one multiplies (6) by g^im/x and sums over i and m, then one obtains in respect to (7) and in respect to the relation following from (3a): 12 im gim g^im/x = lgg/x = 0 the conservation law for matter and the gravitational field together in the form: /x (T^ + t^) = 0 (8) where t^ (the "energy tensor" of the gravitational field) is given by: t^ = 12 ^ g^ ^ ^ g^ ^ ^ (8a) The reasons that drove me to the introduction of the second member on the right-hand side of (2a) and (6), become clear from the following considerations, that are completely analogous to those given at the place just mentioned (p. 785).
When the disc L is at S, it almost exactly coincides with its shadow. When the eclipse of 1919 confirmed my intuition, I was not in the least surprised. When the editor asked me to write something about Bertrand Russell, my admiration and respect far that author at once induced me to say yes. When the editor asked me to write something about Bertrand Russell, my admiration and respect for that author at once induced me to say yes. When the equal velocities are resumed, it is in a direction different from the previous one. When the extensive similarity which exists be- tween the properties of light and those of the elastic waves in ponderable bodies was revealed in the first half of the nineteenth century, the ether hypothesis acquired a new support.
When the rod is taken away without having touched the metal, the leaves immediately fall back to their normal position instead of remaining separated. When the two hemispheres are set rotating, it is conceivable that the ether in the gap would be disturbed due to viscous flow, and any such flow would be immediately detected by a distru'bance of the interference bands. When we begin our observation the starting-points of the two rods coincide. When we consider the various existing religions as to their essential substance, that is, divested of their myths, they do not seem to me to differ as basically from each other as the propo? When we had to choose between the corpuscular and the wave theory, we decided in favour of the wave theory.
When we realize this, we are led to wonder why the so-called revolutionary epochs of the science of physics bave not more often and more com? When we say that the lightning strokes A and B are simultaneous with respect to be embankment, we mean: the rays of light emitted at the places A and B, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the mid-point M of the length A B of the embankment. When we say that we have suc- ceeded in understanding a group of natural processes, we invariably mean that a constructive theory has been found which covers the processes in question. When we say that we understand a group of natural phenomena, we mean that we have found a constructive theory which embraces them.
When we strip the statement of its mystical ele- ments we mean that we are seeking for the simplest possible system of thought which will bind together the observed facts. When we survey our lives and endeavors, we soon observe that almost the whote of our actions and desires is bound up with the existence of other human beings. When we try to connect cause and effect in the experiences which natural objects afford us, it seems at first as if there were no other mutual actions than those of immediate contact, e.g.
When we try to subject our experiences of bodies by a complete causal scheme, there seems at first sight to be no reciprocal inter- action except what is produced by means of im- mediate contact, e.g., the transmission of motion by impact, pressure or pull, heating or inducing com- bustion by means of a flame, etc. When we were describing the motion of a material point relative to a body of reference, we stated nothing more than the encounters of this point with particular points of the reference-body. When, at the reception of sense-impressions, memory-pictures emerge, this is not yet "thinking."
When, by the special theory of relativity I had arrived at the equivalence of all so-called inertial systems for the formulation of natural laws (1905), the question whether there was not a further equiva- lence of co-ordinate systems followed naturally, to say the least of it. When, however, a certain picture turns up in many such series, then N precisely through such return N it becomes an ordering element for such series, in that it connects series which in themselves are unconnected. When, therefore, the Frencb government sets up and main?
When, therefore, the French Government sets up and maintains an Institute out of public funds in Paris as a permanent organ of the Commission, with a Frenchman as its Director, the outside observer can hardly avoid the impression that French influence predominates in the Commission. Whenever such a con- flict is experienced hard and in- tensively it reacts bacl<: upon our thought world in a de- cisive way. Whenever the position of the magnet is changed, the current reappears, and can be detected by a sufficiently sensitive apparatus. Where can the strength for such a process come from? Where life and death are at stake, rules and obligations go by the board.
Where scientific enquiry is stunted the intellectual life of the nation dries up, which means the withering of many possibilities of future development. Where there was no trace of magnetic force previously, there is now a strong pole. Whereas Grebe and Bachem (Bonn), as a result of their own measurements and those of Evershed and Schwarzschild on the cyanogen bands, have placed the existence of the effect almost beyond doubt, while other investigators, particularly St. John, have been led to the opposite opinion in consequence of their measurements. Whereas in classical physics we spoke of positions and velocities of one particle, we must now consider probability waves, in a three-dimensional continuum corresponding to this one-particle problem.
Whereas they had formerly de- manded of an ultimate theory that it should be based upon fundamental concepts of a purely mechanical kind (e.g., mass-densities', velocities, deformations, forces of gravitation), they gradually became accus- tomed to admitting strengths of electrical and mag- netic fields as fundamental concepts alongside of the mechanical ones, without Insisting on a mechanical interpretation of them. Whether there is an ether or not, uniform velocity ivith respect to it can never he detected. Whether this knowledge springs from an ability of the human mind or from experience, from some collaboration of the two or from some other source, is not for the mathematician to decide.
Whether this was to apply to absolutely any (constant) trans- formations of co-ordinates or only to certain ones, I could not for the moment say. Whether this will actually come about in a satisfactory man? Whether we find the way of peace or continue along the old road of brute force, so unworthy of our civilization, depends on ourselves. While it is true that in the Soviet Union the minority rules, I do not consider that inter? While it is true that science, to the extent of its grasp of causative connections, may reach im? While it is true that scientific results are entirely independent from religious or moral considerations, those indi?
While now I want to introduce geometrical figures in the manifold of the variables ( , y, z, t)^ it may be convenient to leave {y, ~) out of account, and to treat .r and t as any possible pair of co-ordinates in a plane, refered to oblique axes.
While the Academy profoundly regrets the turn events have taken, this regret is inspired by the thought that a man of the highest scientific authority, whom many years of work among Germans and many years of membership of our society must have made familiar with the German character and German habits of thought, should have chosen this moment to associate himself with a body of people abroad who partly no doubt through ignorance of actual conditions and events have done much damage to our German people by disseminating erroneous views and unfounded rumours. While the failure of classica!mechanics, as revealed by the theory of relativity, is connected with the finite speed of light (its avoidance 6f being ao ) , it was discovered at the begin?
While unreasonable demands are made on this portion, the remainder is automatically excluded from the process of production. While we consider the state of a body to be completely determined by the positions and velocities of a very large, yet finite, number of atoms and electrons, we make use of continuous spatial functions to describe the electromagnetic state of a given volume, and a finite number of parameters cannot be regarded as sufficient for the complete determination of such a state. While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists.
While wrestling with the problems, however, one will never give up the hope that this greatest of all aims can really be attained to a very high degree. White light is a composi- White light is a composi- tion of corpuscles belonging tion of waves of all wave- to different colours, whereas lengths, whereas in the spec- in the spectrum they are trum they are separated, separated. White light is, so to speak, a jnixture of corpuscies._of^different kinds, belonging to different colours. Who can doubt that Moses was a better leader of humanity than Machiavelli? Who is the imaginary reader for whom it is meant? Who knows if anyone else would have thought of it if he had not?
Who would imagine that this simple law has plunged the conscientiously thoughtful physicist into the greatest intellectual difficulties? Who would presume today to decide the question whether the law of causation and the differential law, these ultimate premises of the Newtonian view of nature, must definitely be given up? Whoever does net know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. Whoever is concerned with this prob? Whoever undertakes to set himself up as judge in the field of Truth and K.nowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods. Whoever will preserve the spirit must also take care of the body to which the spirit is bound.
Why are higher temperatures (and, thus, higher molecular energies) required to add a short-wavelength component to the radiation emitted by an object? Why believe in unchangeable distance? Why believe, as we did some pages ago, in absolute time flowing in the same way for all observers in all c.s.? Why do Maxwell's equations differ in form and character from the equations of classical mechanics? Why does the color of light, and not its intensity, determine whether a certain photochemical reaction occurs? Why is it that alongside of the notion derived by abstraction from everyday life, of ponderable matter the physicists set the notion of the existence of an- other sort of matter, the ether?
Why is light of short wavelength generally more effective chemically than light of longer wavelength? Why is the danger more menacing than in years gone by? Why is the equivalence of the practically-rigid body and the body of geometry which suggests itself so readily denied by Poincare and other investigators? Why is the equivalence of the practicallyrigid body and the body of geometrywhich suggests itself so readilydenied by Poincare and other investigators? Why is the speed of photoelectrically produced cathode rays independent of the light's intensity? Why must every individual and every nation tremble for their existence?
Why popular fancy should seize upon me, a scientist dealing in abstract things and happy if left alone, is one of those manifestations of mass psychology that are beyond me. Why should I dis- tinguish the system C, which is physically perfectly equivalent to the systems C', from the latter by as- suming that the ether is at rest in respect to it ? Why should he fail to call some spot on the face of the globe his own? Why should one open one's doors to a person who devours hard-boiled capitalists with as much appetite and gusto as the Cretan Minotaur in days gone by devoured luscious Greek maidens, and on top of that is low-down enough to reject every sort of war, except the unavoidable war with one's own wife? Why should the Jew ignore his past?
Why should we take so much interest in the ob- server in his rotating room? Why then should it not be the right thing for the physicist to let the philosopher do the philosophizing? Why were another seven years required for the construction of the general theory of relativity? Why, then, should it not be the right thing for the physicist to let the philosopher do the three years before on the general theory of rel philosophizing? Whyr In a piece of ordinary iron the two mag- netic fluids are mixed, so that no net effect results. Will it be a field theory; will it be in essence a statis- tical theory? Will it need new disasters to induce the countries to undertake to enforce every decision of the recognized international court? Will its length still appear to be one yard?
Will the force due to the bombardment be more or less effective than before? Will the further development be along the line chosen in quantum physics, or is it more likely that new revolutionary ideas will be introduced into physics? Will the laws of mechanics be valid for these new c.s.? Will the road of advance again make a sharp turn, as it has so often done in the past? Will they have enough courage to overcome their own national ties to the extent that is necessary to induce the peoples of the world to change their deep-rooted national traditions in a most radical fashion? Will you discuss this proposal with our friends by way of setting the ball rolling?
With 182 COSMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS an appropriate choice of the system of co-ordinates the stellar velocities are very small in comparison with that of light. With P as the initial point, we shall establish a system of reference in the following way : the /-axis will be laid along PQ, the a -axis in the direction of QP^. With a measuring-rod at rest relatively to K', t.be quotient would be greater than 71'. With a. definite bnt extremely small density, matter is in equilibrium, without any internal materiai forces (pressures) being req'.1.ired to maintain equilibrium. With absence of mental stimulus of this kind, buman cooperation would be entirely impossible; the desire for the approvai of one's fellowman certainly is one of the most important binding powers of society.
With absence of mental stimulus of this kind, human cooperation would be entirely impossible; the desire far the approva] of one's fellow-man certainly is one of the most important binding powers of society. With all his knowledge of the details, his eye is immovably fixed on the underlying principle.
With and n given, the number of possible distributions of the n molecules over the considered energy interval equals , which, according to Stirlings formula and equation (3), can be replaced by , for which one may also write , (4) the product running over all r and s. If one extends the formation of the product over all values of s from 1 to #, then (4) obviously represents the total number of complexions, or the probability, in the sense of Planck, of a (macroscopic) state of the gas defined by the . With clocks so adjusted, we can assign the time to events which take place near any one of them. With due consideration for the difficulties involved in this task, I have no doubt about one point.
With emancipation the position changed, particularly for those Jews who turned to the intellectual professions. With every point of the continuum, we associate arbitrarily four numbers, x1, x2, x3, x4, which are known as " co-ordinates." With increasing values of r, F increases from zero up to a maximum value which is determined by the " world-radius," but for still further increasing values of r, the area gradually diminishes to zero. With it the tradition which depends on it will inevitably collapse also, and a fruitful nursery of culture turn to wilderness. With matter and force as our fundamental concepts, we can hardly imagine simpler assumptions than that forces act along the line con- necting the particles and depend only on the distance.
With our pendulum, for example, mechanical energy is gradually converted by friction into heat. With our pre-scientific concepts we are very much in the position of our archaeologist in regard to the ontological problem. With primitive man it is above all fear that evokes religious notions fear of hunger, wild beasts, sickness, death. With primitive man it is above all fear that evokes religious notions? With reference to K (Galileian reference-body) the laws of nature were to be as simple as possible. With reference to K^,, the law of motion is a four-dimensional straight line and thus a geodesic. With reference to a second Galileian system we shall suppose that the corresponding differences for these two events are dx1, dy1, dz1, dt1.
With reference to it, however, there exists (during the period of application of the brakes) a gravitational field which is directed forwards and which is variable with respect to time. With reference to our little rods N defined as unit lengths N the marble slab is no longer a Euclidean continuum, and we are also no longer in the position of defining Cartesian coordinates directly with their aid, since the above construction can no longer be carried out. With reference to this system, all the com- ponents B^^ of the Riemann's Tensor [equation i'3] vanish. With reference to this system, all the com- ponents B^^ of the Riemann's Tensor vanish.
With regard to the influence of the United States upon the United Nations Assembly, I wish to say that, in my opinion, it stems not only from the eco? With respect to K all the rods upon the periphery experience the Lorentz contraction, but the rods upon the diameter do not experience this contraction (along their lengths!). With respect to K the description of the process is as follows: z the momentum of a complex of radiation moving in a fixed direction. With respect to K0 the law of motion corresponds to a four-dimensional straight line, i.e. With respect to an arbitrary inertial system, s2 may be determined by measurements; with a given unit of measure it is a completely determinate quantity, associated with an arbitrary pair of events.
With respect to the Galileian reference-body K, such a ray of light is transmitted rectilinearly with the velocity c. It can easily be shown that the path of the same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we consider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body K1). With respect to this system the field will appear to be singular at every bridge. With respect to this system, tberefore, the contravariant energy? With such an interpretation of the spatial coordinates the question of the validity of Euclidean geometry becomes a problem of physics. With the aid of a little mathematics we are able to go much further. With the aid of this example it is clearly seen that there is no such thing as an independently existing trajectory (lit.
With the discovery of the relativity of simul- taneity, space and time were merged in a single continuum in the same way as the three-dimensions of space had been before. With the discussion of this problem, indeed the postulation of real objects which affects also the notion of reality, and, generally speaking, of the existence we will not concern ourselves but we of "the real world," have justification shall take the existence of sense experi only in so far as they are connected with ences as given, that is to say, as psychic sense impressions between which they form a mental connection. With the elementary quanta of matter we came across the same difficulty that we met with in the light quanta.
With the experimental technique available at that time Galileo had little chance of determining the velocity of light in this way. With the extensive specialization of scientific research which the nineteenth century brought about, it has become rare far I{, A. LORENTZ's WORK 71 a man occupying a leading position in one of the sciences to manage at the same time to do valuable service to the commu? With the given equation between p and p, and the equation dx.. dxfJ _ g..fJ ds ds - ' are sufficient, ga13 being given, to define the six unknowns dx 1 dx 2 dx 3 dx 4 p, p, ds' ds' ds' ([S If the g,.v are also unknown, the equations (53) are brought in.
With the given physical interpreta- tion of coordinates and time, this is by no means merely a conventional step, but implies certain hypotheses concerning the actual behavior of moving measuring-rods and clocks, which can be experimentally vali- dated or disproved. With the help of (61) and (64), it is easy to show that these energy-components of the electromagnetic field in the case of the special theory of relativity give the well-known Maxwell? With the help of (61) and (64?) With the help of Newton's laws we can deduce the motion of the earth from the force acting between the sun and the earth. With the help of physical theories we try to find our way through the maze of observed facts, to order and understand the world of our sense impressions.
With the help of such a lantern it was possible to determine the earths orbit, in the following way : First of all, in every year there comes a moment when the earth E lies exactly on the line joining the sun S and the lantern M. If at this moment we look from the earth E at the lantern M, our line of sight will coincide with the line SM (sun-lantern). With the help of the Lorentz transformations the special principle of relativity can be expressed thus: The laws of nature are invariant with respect to Lorentz-transformations ( i.e., a Iaw of nature does not change its form if one intro?
With the help of the above set of equations, which is known as the Lorentz transformation, he succeeded in showinsc how the P'itzc^erald contraction results as a consequence of " fortuitous compensation of opposing effects." With the help of the equation of the geodetic line we cari now easily deduce the laws by which new tensors can be formed from old by differentiation. With the help of these equations we transform the above equations of motion from system k to system K, and obtain. With the help of these new field concepts Faraday succeeded in form?

With the introduction of this system one might consent to a certain amount of "inflation," as compared with the present monetary situation, if one could believe that the State would really make a rational use of the windfall thus accruing to it. With the knowledge we already have of the changes of the field, how shall we describe everything that is going on here, in the field language? With the majority of intellectual workers stili so excited, truly intemational congresses on the grand scale cannot yet be held. With the majority of intellectual workers still so excited, truly international congresses on the grand scale cannot yet be held.
With the progress of science, the realm of physics has so expanded that it seems to be limited only by the limitations of the method itself. With the tangential position, therefore, the gravitational field of the point of mss has no in:fiuence on the length of a rod. With the vision of genius, Herzl saw that the rehabilitation of Palestine would lend a new cohesive force, a new meaning, and a new dignity to the Jewish people. With them, it ought to be possible to arrive at the description, that is to say, the theory, of every natural process, including life, by means of pure deduction, if that process of deduction were not far beyond the capacity of the human intellect.
With these principles1 as my basis I deduced inter alia the following result ( 8):N Let a system of plane waves of light, referred to the system of co-ordinates (x,y,z), possess the energy l; let the direction of the ray (the wave-normal) make an angle ? With this 8.im in view Jet it now be granted that : For infinitely sma:t iour-dimensional regions the theory of relativity in the rc.sricted sense is appropriate, if the co? With this absorption the energy of B increases by E. The body B stays at rest with respect to K0 by reasons of symmetry. With this and with a second difficulty prevailing here we shall have to deal in detail later.
With this conception one not only obtains the representation of an elementary particle by using only the field equations, that is, without introducing new field quantities to describe the density of matter; one is also able to understand the atomistic character of matter as well as the fact that there can be no particles of negative mass. With this distribution of mass, therefore, the required finite contin uum of the x1, x2 , x3, with constant x4, will be a spberical space. With this in mind I, an old man, greet you Japanese schoolchildren from afar and ahope that your generation may some day put mine to shame. With this in mind I, an old man, greet you Japanese schoolchildren from afar and hope that your generation may some day put mine to shame.
With this interpretation of quantum mechanics one can understand why this theory can easily account for the fact that weak disturbing forces are able to produce alter? With this interpretation the inertial system loses its meaning and one has an "explanation", far the equality of heavy and inertial mass ( the same property of matter appears as weight or as inertia depending on the mode of description ). With this negative motive there goes a personal one. With this quantum hypothesis he dethroned classical physics as applied to the case where suf- ficiently small masses are moved at sufficiently low speeds and high rates of acceleration, so that today the laws of motion propounded by Galileo and New- ton can only be allowed validity as limiting laws. With this restriction, the c.s.
With this simple but fundamental physical apparatus, a rod and a clock, we can confirm this mechanical law with a certain degree of accuracy. With this, everything essential has been said with regard to the algebraic properties of tensors. With two very long magnetized rods we could investigate the attraction (or repulsion) of their poles when brought near one another. With what speed does the electromagnetic wave spread in empty space? With' what right N the reader will ask N doe^ this man operate so carelessly and primitively with ideas in such a problematic realm without making even the least effort to prove anything?
Within matter it takes part in the motion of matter and in empty space it has everywhere a velocity; so that the ether has a definitely assigned velocity throughout the whole of space. Within the traditions of the Jewish people exists a striving toward righteous ness and understanding that should be of service to the rest of the nations, both now and in the future. Without "ethical culture" there is no salvation for humanity.
Without affecting the general character of our considerations, we may and will assume that the electron, at the moment when we give it our attention, is at the origin of the co-ordinates, and moves with the velocity v along the axis of X of the system K. It is then clear that at the given moment (t = 0) the electron is at rest relatively to a system of co-ordinates which is in parallel motion with velocity v along the axis of X. Without committing any fundamental error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these frameworks would continually interfere with each other, owing to the impenetrability of solid bodies. Without creative personalities able to think and judge independently, the upward develop?
Without creative, independently thinking and judging personalities the upward development of society is as unthinkable as the development of the individual personality without the nourishing soil of the community. Without disarmament there can be no lasting peace. Without doubt the present economie di:fficulties will even? Without going into details, we can see the possibility of a mechanical explanation. Without going into the details of this and similar experiments we can ask the following question: can these phenomena be explained if the light waves are longitudinal? Without going into the formal structure of the theory, we shall characterize some features of the new gravitational theory compared with the old.
Without influencing the generality of treatment, we can and we will assume that, at the moment we are considering, ON THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES 31 the electron is at the origin o co-ordinates^ and moves with the velocity v along the X-axis of the system. Without it the following reflection would have been impossible: In a system of reference rotating relatively to an inert system, the laws of disposition of rigid bodies do not correspond to the rules of Euclidean geometry on account of the Lorentz contraction; thus if we admit non-inert systems we must abandon Euclidean geometry.

Without such confidence, socia!cooperation is made impossible or at least difficult. Without such freedom there would have been no Shake?
Without the belief that it is possible to grasp the reality with our theoretical constructions, without the belief in the inner harmony of our world, there could be no science. Without the localization of the electro? Without the sense of fellowship with men of like mind, of preoccupation with the objective, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific research, life would have seemed to me empty. Without this discovery it would not have been possible to establish a workable theory of molecules and atoms and the energy processes that govem their transfarma? Without this second kind of outward liberty, free? Without worrying about the statement that it may be chance, let us assume we do see the light point through the two crystals.
Women and War In my opinion, the patriotic women ought to be sent to the front in the next war instead of the men. Words are and remain an empty sound, and the road to perdition has ever been accampanied by lip service to an ideai. Words are and remain an empty sound, and the road to perdition has ever been accompanied by lip service to an ideai.

Working is thinking, hence it is not always easy to give an exact accounting of one's time. Working oi this hypothesis, Fresnel effered his famous ether convee tion theory. Worse stili, this specialization makes it in? Worse still, as a result of this specialization, it is becoming increasingly difficult for even a rough general grasp of science as a whole, without which the true spirit of research is inevitably handicapped, to keep pace with progress. Would it not be possible to fili such places with young people who wish to think out scientific problems, especially of a mathematical or philosophical nature.

Y ., on the occasion of the celebration of the tercentenary of higher education in America, October 15, 1936. YOU wish to learn from the theoretical physicist anything about the methods which he uses, I would give you the following piece of advice. Yet I respect the dogma that time and space have independent existences. Yet Judaism seems to me one of its purest and most vigorous manifestations. Yet even this answer does not provide and extravagant form of conflict be- tween man and man was deliberate, for here we have the best occasion of discover- ing ways and means to render all armed conflicts impossible. Yet in another sense that dose association was fatai for the moral idea. Yet it cannot furnish the very goals.
Yet it is equally clear that knowledge of what is does not open the door di? Yet it is equally clear that knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what shoul d be. Yet it is good-indeed, it is indispensable-tbat reprcsenta? Yet it is the whole compouuded group which as a whole gives us occasion for thought. Yet it seems to me that the strong moral tradition of the Jewish nation has to a large extent shaken itself free from this fear. Yet most likely the mental shape of an individual growing up under such conditions, would be very poor. Yet new, still more difficult problems arise which have not been definitely settled as yet. Yet no serious doubt of the mechanical foundation of physics arose, in the first piace because nobody knew where to find a foundation of another sort.
Yet on the other hand it is certain that mathematics generally, and particularly geometry, owes its existence to the need which was felt of learning something about the relations of real things to one another. Yet primitive man created by friction sufficient heat to ignite wood. Yet some marvellous compensation has evidently tai^en place which has completely masked the " absolute '"' velocity of the earth. Yet the ancients knew something which we seem to have forgotten. Yet the co=unity can do much to further this achievement, too, at least by not interfering with its development. Yet the community can do much to further this achievement, too, at least by not interfering with its development.
Yet the most careful experiments showed, as Eddington says, " that both parts of the beam took the same time as tested by the interference bands produced. Yet the process which I bave indicated plays a very impor? Yet the standing wave is the result of interference between two or, generally, even more moving waves. Yet the world at large itself in a vicious circle since the UN powers seem to be incapable of making up their minds on this score. Yet their realiza tion cannot wait for a graduai historical development to take its course. Yet there never was any doubt as to the striving for culture. Yet this con- ception of the real accomplished much: how came it that people felt themselves impelled to forsake it?
Yet today we must recognize with horror that these pillars of civilized human existence bave lost their firmness. Yet toward the end of his short life he wrote a paper in which he presented as the foundation of physics a mechanical theory freed from the force-concept. Yet we know from mechanics that interstellar space does not resist the motion of material bodies. Yet we may choose to be conservative and seek a solution within the frame of old ideas. Yet, I do not think that the so-called "relativistic" viewpoint is correct, not even when dealing witl1 the more subtle mora] decisions. Yet, as a general rule, intellectual work in moderation, so far from retarding cure, indirectly helps it farward, just as mod?

You attempt to justif y this indictment by analyzing in your fashion the individua!actions of this government since the end of the last war. You attempt to show that the Assembly of the United Nations is a mere puppet show controlled by the United States and hence the American capitalists. You believe that a word from me would suffice to get something done in this sphere? You cannot rely on that, my young friends.
You cannot subjugate a nation forcibly unless you wipe out every man, woman, and child. You could argue against our representation thus: there is little sense in representing a unit of time by a segment, in combining it mechanically with the space, forming the two-dimensional continuum from the two one-dimensional continua. You have a mighty ally in the German reactionaries and militarists. You have also remarked that a "good word" on my part for "the German people" would have produced a great effect abroad. You have decided to offer me an award on this occasion. You have done what only the born artist can do.
You have not hesitated to apply your energies to a field where there are no laurels to be won, but quiet, loyal work to be done in the interests of the general standard of intellectual and spiritual life, which is in peculiar danger to-day owing to a variety of circumstances. You have not merely preached moral sermons to your fellows; you have actually mocked at things which many of them held sacred. You have shown with irresistible clearness how inseparably the combative and destructive instincts are bound up with the amative and vital ones in the human psyche. You know, I am sure, from history how much unnecessary suffering such rigid beliefs have inHicted upon mankind.
You make these charming little figures dance in a miniature world in front of which the Graces stand sentinel and permit no bitterness to enter. You may be sure that I shall do everything in my power along the lines you indicate, but nothing can be achieved as directly as you think. You may find it boring or interesting, dull or exciting, but our aim will be accomplished if these pages give you some idea of the eternal struggle of the inventive human mind for a fuller understanding of the laws governing physical phenomena. You no doubt believe that we must explain everything in terms of mechanics. You smile incredulously, but I bave bad plenty of direct experience and will tell you about it. You smile incredulously, but I have had plenty of direct experience and will tell you about it.
You will all understand the meaning of this parable. You will hardly find one among the profounder sort of i;cientifc minds without a religious feeling of his own. You will say to yourselves, the fellows a working physicist himself and ought therefore to leave all questions of the structure of theoretical science to the epistemologists. You will surely understand that Ido not find the courage to brave this danger. You will, I am sure, be able to get some Jewish friend of conciliation to translate it. You're almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future. You, Mr. Shaw, have succeeded in winning the affection and joyous admiration of the world while pursuing a path that has led many others to a martyr's crown.

we can easily show that the energy-components of the electro-magnetic field, in the case of the special relativity theory, give rise to the well-known Maxwell-Poynting expressions. we have for any combination of indices (U) A''''=A'''' or (14a) A =A . we have, by differentiation, r a da ^=^ q dq (30) i '" - OQ vcr ^ jxcr L a.> err By mixed multiplication with g and .7 v respectiyely we obtain (changing the mode of writing the indices). we may obtain a tensor of rank ? we must by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which Lorentz had still left it. we obtain a line which has all the properties of the straight lines of the Euclidean geometry. we obtain from (4a ) by inner multiplice.tion by J a, on account of the antisymmetry of the relation (8).
